I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying .

It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish . __eou__ Oh , I would really appreciate that .

His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . __eou__ Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy !

And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ?
I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . __eou__ Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse .

What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap .
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__ It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . __eou__ Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . __eou__ It can also entertain your passengers like me . __eou__ That's the point .
Hello ? __eou__ Hello ? Mr . Bernie . My name is Lisa . I hope I ’ m not disturbing you . I just heard about your daughter .

I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . __eou__ No problem .
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny .
May I help you ? __eou__ I'm looking for a pair of shoes . __eou__ What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . __eou__ I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice .

What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway .
Would you like any toast , dear ? __eou__ Um ? __eou__ Toast , dear ? __eou__ As you like . __eou__ Would you like any tea , dear ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . __eou__ Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . __eou__ Leave me alone .
What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? __eou__ Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . __eou__ Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . __eou__ I still think nobody plays for nothing .
Thanks a million . __eou__ Don't mention it .
Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? __eou__ No , who won ? __eou__ It's George . __eou__ Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good .
About my driving test , did I do well ? __eou__ You did a fabulous job . __eou__ Are you telling me that I passed the test ? __eou__ That's what I'm telling you . __eou__ What did I mess up on ? __eou__ You did mess up a little on one thing . __eou__ Tell me . __eou__ You had a little trouble on your parallel parking . __eou__ That's not easy for me . __eou__ That's something that you really need to work on . __eou__ Am I still going to get my license ? __eou__ You're still going to get it .
Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . __eou__ Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . __eou__ You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? __eou__ No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . __eou__ Do you ever get lonely living alone ? __eou__ Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely !
Do you like the apartment so far ? __eou__ I see a problem . __eou__ What ’ s the problem ? __eou__ I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking . __eou__ That ’ s no big deal . __eou__ It ’ s going to be a problem when my water bill comes . __eou__ What do you want me to do about it ? __eou__ I would like you to fix the problem . __eou__ I won ’ t be able to do that right now . __eou__ Well , I won ’ t be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed . __eou__ Fine , I ’ ll have it fixed for you . __eou__ I ’ m happy that we ’ Ve come to an agreement .
Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? __eou__ I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . __eou__ Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . __eou__ Can I bring my camera with me ? __eou__ Sure . Bring enough films , please . __eou__ I sure will .
How do you feel ? __eou__ I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . __eou__ Here is the bigger size . __eou__ This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ?
What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? __eou__ I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . __eou__ When is your garden at its best ? __eou__ It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ? __eou__ Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? __eou__ They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? __eou__ For me , I think starting school was more exciting . __eou__ Does that mean work isn't that great ? __eou__ It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . __eou__ But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun . __eou__ That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . __eou__ I hope you're right .
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again .
I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? __eou__ Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . __eou__ Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? __eou__ In some way , she is more modern . __eou__ If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . __eou__ If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely .

What is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . __eou__ I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now .

You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction .

That's really a headache . __eou__ Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side .
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Do you like sports , Janice ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me .
When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . __eou__ You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . __eou__ I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . __eou__ But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her .
I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__ Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . __eou__ Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . __eou__ Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . __eou__ Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . __eou__ I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .
Don't do that . You are asking for trouble . __eou__ I don't care .

I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . __eou__ Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . __eou__ Sure . Join my class next week .

Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother .

I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing .

No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies !

Pardon me .

You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . __eou__ But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know.Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . __eou__ But what about parking ?

Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog .
Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ I want to post this package to the United States . __eou__ Do you want to mail it by air or by sea ? __eou__ By sea .

Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide .

( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? __eou__ Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__ As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__ To begin with , I have to use chopsticks . __eou__ But you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__ Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table . __eou__ Yes , table etiquette .

Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow ! __eou__ Anything strange about that ? __eou__ Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate .

you're finally here ! What took so long ? __eou__ I got stuck in traffic again .

The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ it would be better for the environment , too . __eou__ I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__ taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__ the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . __eou__ well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__ that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__ so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__ yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .

Let's go to Wangfujing by bus . __eou__ Better take the subway .

You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . __eou__ Where do we pay the fare ? __eou__ Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token . Then , you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . __eou__ Let me pay for it . Where can I get a subway map ? __eou__ Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one . It's free fo charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . __eou__ Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? __eou__ No , you don't have to . Here comes the train .

Don't they have carts ? __eou__ Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . __eou__ Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . __eou__ Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . __eou__ Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? __eou__ Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! __eou__ How awful , poor guy . __eou__ Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . __eou__ Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? __eou__ Yup .

So I want him to have a good VCR to use . __eou__ May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? __eou__ DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? __eou__ It is very similar . The technology is the same . __eou__ Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? __eou__ For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . __eou__ But isn't it more expensive ? __eou__ It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . __eou__ And why not ? __eou__ Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . __eou__ Hmm .

He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?

Do you think children watch too much Tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
He is penny wise and pound-foolish . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . __eou__ Maybe all of us are the same .

Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ Those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant .

He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it .

But finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__ You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__ Guess where we ended up . __eou__ I don't know . Where ? __eou__ When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . __eou__ Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__ I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__ Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__ I know it is . I don't know how it happened . __eou__ Hmm , maybe I do . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Maybe I have an idea how it happened . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__ Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? __eou__ Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ What ? __eou__ His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things .

I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . __eou__ You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . __eou__ I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . __eou__ You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that .

Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? __eou__ I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__ This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__ I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . __eou__ Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . __eou__ There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . __eou__ I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . __eou__ I know what you mean .

I'm going to the pub tonight . __eou__ Don't get drunk .
How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good .

I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day .
Are you ready to leave ? __eou__ Give me a sec .

They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . __eou__ Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .

What are you going to do ? __eou__ It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? __eou__ You wanna shoot some hoops ? __eou__ I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . __eou__ Where's your girlfriend ?

Aren't you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I'd forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come .

You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . __eou__ What if I make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? __eou__ No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . __eou__ I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . __eou__ OK , I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . __eou__ How long before I find out what their decision is ? __eou__ By now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept .

Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? __eou__ I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . __eou__ I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? __eou__ I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . __eou__ I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? __eou__ Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? __eou__ Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . __eou__ I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now .
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by us . __eou__ Well , you always say you're busy . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . __eou__ I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . __eou__ Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . __eou__ You mean I am groaned a few words ? __eou__ Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage .
I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! __eou__ So glad that you think so ! __eou__ I think you deserve a promotion . __eou__ Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess .
What ? Your golden watch is lost ? __eou__ Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . __eou__ It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . __eou__ Let's get it back .
Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? __eou__ Yes , is that you , Allen ? __eou__ Yes , how are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? __eou__ Sure.Thank you very much . __eou__ Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? __eou__ Ok , see you . __eou__ See you .
I'm back . __eou__ What have you done ? __eou__ Going shopping . It tires me too much . __eou__ Why don't you go shopping online ? __eou__ Can I ? __eou__ Why not ? Let me recommend a website . __eou__ OK . What does it sell ? __eou__ It sells almost everything you can see in the department . __eou__ That's great .
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand .
I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? __eou__ We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . __eou__ You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . __eou__ Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much .

But it has an aluminum handle . __eou__ Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . __eou__ Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . __eou__ That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? __eou__ Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . __eou__ I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .

I feel lightheaded and weak . __eou__ Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? __eou__ I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__ Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__ Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath .
Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? __eou__ Sure , which beach are we going to ? __eou__ I wanted to go to Malibu beach . __eou__ I like Santa Monica . __eou__ The water there looks so dirty . __eou__ I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . __eou__ I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . __eou__ Is Malibu beach nice ? __eou__ It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . __eou__ So you want to go to Malibu ? __eou__ If that's okay with you . __eou__ Sure , let's go to Malibu .

I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ?

How's your new job going ? __eou__ Really well , thanks . __eou__ How are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ She's not bad .

I think most people do .
What a coincidence seeing you here . ! __eou__ It is , isn't it ?
How's the chicken ? __eou__ It's delicious .
Maybe we all will be all things to all men . __eou__ How terrible ! __eou__ But for the life , we'll be changed by this society . __eou__ I really don't want to go into the world , I feel afraid of it . __eou__ Don't be silly . We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves . __eou__ I know .
I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . __eou__ Don't you know they've already broken up ? __eou__ I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . __eou__ And he's so handsome .
What's your favorite season ? __eou__ I like the freedom of summer with no school . __eou__ Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . __eou__ And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . __eou__ Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... __eou__ And I really like the smells and colors of spring . __eou__ I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! __eou__ But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most !

Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !
What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? __eou__ Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . __eou__ Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it .
Do you think children watch too much tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .

I'm answering the ad in the paper about your car.And I wonder if it is still available ? __eou__ Yes , it's still available . __eou__ Good.Can you give me some information about it ... uh .. mileage and the tires and things like that ? __eou__ Well , it has got low mileage.The tires are in perfect condition and it's in excellent shape .

How was your shopping trip Martin ? __eou__ Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . __eou__ Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ? __eou__ I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . __eou__ And how did you get around town ? __eou__ I took a taxi . It seemed the easiest thing to do . __eou__ Right , so you didn ’ t get lost ? __eou__ I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China . They soon showed me the way !
I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . __eou__ I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ That's a good idea !
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks .
Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing . __eou__ Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . __eou__ Mary , you say something about it . __eou__ Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled .
Mum , can I finish my homework later ? __eou__ Sorry . You know the rules . __eou__ But I want to watch TV now . __eou__ That ’ s out of the question . __eou__ Please . __eou__ Not a chance . __eou__ Not even for an hour ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s impossible .
What did her boss say to you ? __eou__ He asked me to beef up in the work . __eou__ Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . __eou__ Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days .
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right .
Oh , no . It looks like we're late . __eou__ Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . __eou__ There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? __eou__ They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . __eou__ That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . __eou__ Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening !
Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? __eou__ No , I assure you . __eou__ And you'll repair the television , won't you ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__ Do you promise ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? __eou__ I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . __eou__ But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? __eou__ Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . __eou__ Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! __eou__ Ok . I'll keep my promise .
Hello sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . __eou__ I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . __eou__ Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . __eou__ We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . __eou__ What about Wi-fi ? __eou__ Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . __eou__ One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
Next time you buy veggies or fruits , have them bagged and weighed before you come here . __eou__ Sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ The total comes to US $ 65.81 .

That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ? __eou__ I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there . __eou__ That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . __eou__ I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . __eou__ Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . __eou__ We'll see what happens after court .
Waiter , a menu please ! __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Thank you . Could you tell me the specials today ? __eou__ The special today is fried chicken , and beef is good too . __eou__ Ok , let's think about it for a minute . __eou__ Well , I'll be back in a minute .
Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . __eou__ I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my sister , you know .
Good evening . Welcome to our restaurant . __eou__ Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . The rooms are not available now .

Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that .

Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do . __eou__ Well , I love hip hop dancing , so I should probably dance . Do you know how to rap ? __eou__ Oh yeah ! I'm a great rapper . And I know all the Vanilla Ice lyrics by heart . __eou__ Excellent . I'll start practicing my dance moves .
Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? __eou__ No . I caught a cold two days ago .

So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? __eou__ I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they're kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . __eou__ Because it was her husband who beat her . __eou__ It is incredible . __eou__ She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest .
How is your house hunting going ? __eou__ Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ How much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! __eou__ How long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . __eou__ Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ No , I thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ I don't think I can afford that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .

The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it .

Pets OK . __eou__ How much is the rent ? __eou__ The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . __eou__ When is the place available ? __eou__ It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work .
how did you do on your BELTS exam ? __eou__ fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . __eou__ that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? __eou__ yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . __eou__ do you know where the visa office is ? __eou__ no . __eou__ it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . __eou__ that's not too far away .

Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ? __eou__ I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying . __eou__ I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . __eou__ that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better .
You look so excited . What happened ? __eou__ You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . __eou__ So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . __eou__ How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ? __eou__ I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . __eou__ But there won't be anything good left .
I'd like to purchase a pan . __eou__ Is there any particular size that you want ? __eou__ Well , I cook a lot of big meals . __eou__ What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 ” pan . __eou__ Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy . __eou__ Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . __eou__ Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . __eou__ No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . __eou__ Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . __eou__ I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? __eou__ Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you .

Holly , I just heard some terrible news . __eou__ Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . __eou__ What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . __eou__ That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . __eou__ Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? __eou__ No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me !
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect .

What is the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . __eou__ But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . __eou__ Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . __eou__ My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world .

Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you very much .
Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy .

How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again .
Excuse me , Miss , can you tell me where the bank is ? __eou__ Yes , the bus doesn ’ t go there directly.You have to take the No . 26 bus for five stops and then change to a No . 16 bus and get off at the third stop.When you get off , you can see the bank . __eou__ How long will it take me to get there ? __eou__ It ’ s about an hour . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__ Not at all .
Wow . Look how polite your son has become . __eou__ Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf .
Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? __eou__ Hi , I am just looking . __eou__ It's a good car . __eou__ What year is it ? __eou__ 1999 . __eou__ How about the mileage ? __eou__ 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . __eou__ What do you mean 7B __eou__ Highway miles are not as bad as local miles .

He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally .

Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ Umm ... I think so . What's up ? __eou__ I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating .
Hurry up , get in . __eou__ I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! __eou__ OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! __eou__ Geez !

Move , move ! __eou__ What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__ Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! __eou__ I ’ m going as fast as I can ! __eou__ Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . __eou__ You ’ re such a geek !

Do you carry black ink ? __eou__ The ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir . __eou__ I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink . __eou__ Then I'm afraid there's none in stock . __eou__ Well , I'll settle for blue-black . I'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes . __eou__ They come in packages of ten or twenty . __eou__ Give me a package of twenty , then . And where do I find shoelaces ? __eou__ On counter three . __eou__ Thank you . I never can find my way around this store . __eou__ I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here .
Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ The dress is made on your measurement . __eou__ It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better . __eou__ OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow .
Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? __eou__ I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . __eou__ Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . __eou__ Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . __eou__ I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? __eou__ Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . __eou__ It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . __eou__ Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? __eou__ Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! __eou__ Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__ Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . __eou__ It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__ That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? __eou__ No .

I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat .

I really enjoy it . __eou__ Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction .

There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies .

This is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one . __eou__ It is genuine , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Any kind of goods are dependable as our shop is well-known throughout the city .

It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . __eou__ The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ Is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way .

So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .

Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? __eou__ There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . __eou__ Why ?

What stresses you out the most ? __eou__ Probably my parents . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . __eou__ You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . __eou__ Your parents are not like that ? __eou__ Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__ What do you do to deal with the stress ? __eou__ Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . __eou__ That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? __eou__ Sure . Sounds great . Let's go .
Are you new here ? __eou__ This is my first day here . __eou__ Are you a freshman in college ? __eou__ I started school somewhere else . __eou__ What school did you transfer from ? __eou__ I started at PCC . __eou__ What made you transfer ? __eou__ My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . __eou__ Did you like PCC ? __eou__ I loved PCC . __eou__ Good luck here . __eou__ I ’ m excited to be here .

I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory .
Does this dress look OK on me ? __eou__ Yes , of course . It seems made to measure . __eou__ Well , I think that one fits me better . What's the price ? __eou__ $ 120 .

Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , I am going to meet a client . __eou__ But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! __eou__ I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . __eou__ I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . __eou__ I thought Henry usually did the conferences . __eou__ Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital .

See you tomorrow , Mary . __eou__ See you tomorrow .

Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here .

Do you have all the ingredients ? __eou__ I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! __eou__ What do we do first ? __eou__ first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . __eou__ Ok . Should I heat the wok ? __eou__ Yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . __eou__ What about the chicken ? __eou__ That needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . __eou__ How about the rice ? __eou__ I'll prepare that . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? __eou__ White rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me !

Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? __eou__ I don ’ t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old . __eou__ Oh you ’ re so kind ! __eou__ Get in .
Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . __eou__ Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful . __eou__ So I'd rather walk or run to work . __eou__ You must be joking !
Bob , I'm really upset with you . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . __eou__ You forgot it last year as well . __eou__ I know , I'm sorry .

You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ...
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world .
What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm feeling a little under the weather .
How nice of you to come ! __eou__ It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ? __eou__ Just fine , thanks.And you ? __eou__ I've never been better , thanks .

Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? __eou__ I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . __eou__ Is rice your staple food , too ? __eou__ Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread .

So people can go and root for their old school team ? __eou__ Yep . And relive those good old high school days . __eou__ You don't sound too excited about going to your reunion . __eou__ I'm not .

Could you deliver this to my house ? __eou__ Of course . We are always at your service . __eou__ Here is my name card . Thanks . __eou__ You are welcome .

If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . __eou__ My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . __eou__ What do you want ? __eou__ I wouldn't mind a necklace .

Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . __eou__ Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . __eou__ Show me some classic high heels , please . __eou__ Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? __eou__ Black . Classic . __eou__ Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . __eou__ Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . __eou__ OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . __eou__ I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . __eou__ What size ? __eou__ Seven-and-a-half . __eou__ Here we are . How does it fit ? __eou__ Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo __eou__ Have a nice day , Ma ’ am .

Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . __eou__ Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . __eou__ OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect ! I'll take it !
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's not doing too well . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick . __eou__ Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__ That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday . __eou__ Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . __eou__ Thanks . I'll let him know .
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . __eou__ What a great idea ! __eou__ January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . __eou__ I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . __eou__ You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . __eou__ April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . __eou__ That is a good suggestion . __eou__ We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . __eou__ Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . __eou__ I'll put the survey online this afternoon .

You could ’ Ve gotten something for less . __eou__ O . K . Let ’ s compromise , if you agree to only spend $ 75 on books , I ’ ll agree to only spend $ 40 for my next shirt . __eou__ All right . That sounds fair .

I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net .

That's the use of net in E-commerce .

Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .

Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm .

But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u __eou__ yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt . __eou__ yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__ exactly .

Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? __eou__ Oh , I see .

Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . __eou__ Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__ I will have the latest editions .

The tea smells good . What tea is it ? __eou__ It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . __eou__ What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? __eou__ You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . __eou__ They must have some special methods to do this during the process . __eou__ Probably .

But I really love to have after-meal tea . __eou__ What's the advantage about tea ? __eou__ There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . __eou__ Does that mean the stronger the better ? __eou__ No .

Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__ Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__ Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__ How much did she ask for ? __eou__ Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . '

If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . __eou__ what's that for ? __eou__ one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . __eou__ do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? __eou__ sure .

I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . __eou__ You say how high can be exciting ? __eou__ The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . __eou__ I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . __eou__ It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . __eou__ Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more .

That's too much . __eou__ Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . __eou__ Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . __eou__ Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . __eou__ Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__ In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic .

Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile .

I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . __eou__ I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ That's a good idea !

You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . __eou__ Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . __eou__ I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . __eou__ Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . __eou__ Oh , shut up , Roy . __eou__ But honey , I think you ’ re terrific .
