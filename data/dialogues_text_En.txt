The kitchen stinks . __eou__ I'll throw out the garbage .
Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? __eou__ Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed .
Would you mind waiting a while ? __eou__ Well , how long will it be ? __eou__ I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . __eou__ OK . We'll wait .
Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ? __eou__ Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak .

But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before . __eou__ I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive . __eou__ Then I doubt if you like operas at all . __eou__ Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one . __eou__ OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave . __eou__ Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice . __eou__ Me , too .

How would you like to earn the other half ? __eou__ Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ? __eou__ I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned .
We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . __eou__ Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? __eou__ Some high speed chase scene , I think . __eou__ I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . __eou__ I think that they get a pretty good payoff . __eou__ The movie company has to pay them ? __eou__ I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! __eou__ Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see !

Hey , Mom , look what I found ! __eou__ Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house .
What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . __eou__ And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now !
It's time to go . Are you ready ? __eou__ Almost . Let me get my bag .
How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? __eou__ It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? __eou__ I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! __eou__ All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . __eou__ That will be my pleasure .
Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? __eou__ You don't know what you are asking ! __eou__ Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . __eou__ Remember what happened last time ? __eou__ Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? __eou__ Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . __eou__ Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! __eou__ Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ?
Hello . Welcome ! __eou__ Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . __eou__ This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here .

Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? __eou__ No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though . __eou__ I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? __eou__ It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . __eou__ A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . __eou__ I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up . __eou__ Oooo . This sounds serious . __eou__ Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down .
Are you ready to order yet , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . __eou__ Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . __eou__ Ok .

Wait till the guys hear about this ! __eou__ Mike , don't even think about it !
Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . __eou__ I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous . __eou__ Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__ I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming . __eou__ I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive . __eou__ You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea .
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? __eou__ Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . __eou__ It's too expensive . __eou__ If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . __eou__ What's the difference between the two ? __eou__ It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . __eou__ Let me see .
Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ? __eou__ It costs only 25 yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ? __eou__ The price is reasonable because the quality is super . __eou__ But the price is too high . __eou__ How much would you like it to be , then ? __eou__ What about 15 yuan ? __eou__ Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ? __eou__ All right , I'll take it . __eou__ I think you've got a real bargain . __eou__ Thank you .
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? __eou__ There's some leftover pizza from last night . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . __eou__ Do I have any other choices ? __eou__ There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . __eou__ Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! __eou__ You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner !
This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . __eou__ I didn't know you did Yoga . __eou__ I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . __eou__ What have you learned ? __eou__ Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . __eou__ As opposed to short and shallow ? __eou__ Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' __eou__ I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . '
Good evening , madam . May I help you ? __eou__ I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? __eou__ Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . __eou__ That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? __eou__ We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . __eou__ What's the regular price ? __eou__ Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . __eou__ Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . __eou__ That's fine , madam . __eou__ By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . __eou__ Yes , madam .
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ Well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__ Turn on the TV , for what ? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__ I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . __eou__ Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . __eou__ I can try to arrange that for you . __eou__ I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . __eou__ Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? __eou__ It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . __eou__ You're in luck . We still have that little table .
The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . __eou__ Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? __eou__ Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! __eou__ So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... __eou__ Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . __eou__ That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? __eou__ Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! __eou__ I see what you mean !
I've never been to a restaurant like this before . __eou__ It's really different , isn't it ? __eou__ That's a good word to describe it . __eou__ I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . __eou__ I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . __eou__ Well , let's order one for starters . __eou__ I'm in the mood for a Californian . __eou__ That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order .
Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ? __eou__ We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work . __eou__ Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work ! __eou__ It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company . __eou__ Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ? __eou__ You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car . __eou__ Jeans and a tee shirt , right ? __eou__ Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool .
What can I get for you today , sir ? __eou__ I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar . __eou__ Would you like anything else with that ? __eou__ How fresh is that apple pie over there ? __eou__ Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious . __eou__ Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then . __eou__ Is this to stay or to go ? __eou__ I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking .
Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ I don't know how to say it in English . __eou__ We call this a ' parking meter ' . __eou__ Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ? __eou__ P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r .
Would you mind giving me a hand ? __eou__ Okay , Bob , What is it ? __eou__ Help me hang up this picture , please .

Tell me if I've got it straight . __eou__ Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid .
Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? __eou__ You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? __eou__ Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . __eou__ I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . __eou__ And after that ? __eou__ After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle .
Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . __eou__ No kidding ! When did that happen ? __eou__ Early this morning . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . __eou__ Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? __eou__ The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . __eou__ That's amazingly low for such a huge accident !
Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . __eou__ Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? __eou__ I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw . __eou__ Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? __eou__ No , not really , there's just a lot of blood . __eou__ You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . __eou__ I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk . __eou__ Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there .

Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? __eou__ Everything about them was different , even the theaters . __eou__ I'm really interested . Tell me about them . __eou__ Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . __eou__ That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . __eou__ We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . __eou__ Why don't we do that anymore ? __eou__ Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot .
I'm going crazy . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately . __eou__ Well , if there is anything I can do to help , let me know .
Chinese tea is famous all over the world . I want to buy several boxes . __eou__ There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect . __eou__ Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all . __eou__ This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . __eou__ Sounds interesting . What about this ? __eou__ It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . __eou__ What's this ? It smells fragrant . __eou__ It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . __eou__ I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend . __eou__ No problem . Wait for a moment .
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? __eou__ Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . __eou__ Moon cakes ? What is that ? __eou__ The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . __eou__ Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . __eou__ All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . __eou__ What's the difference between these two styles ? __eou__ The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . __eou__ Get me some of each . __eou__ OK , here you are .
Ann , it's terrible ! __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ Look , this is a pimple ! __eou__ Oh , I think it is . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I think it's because of your bad habits ! __eou__ I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . __eou__ I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . __eou__ I wasn't aware of that ! __eou__ You should do better later .
Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded . __eou__ Sure .

What is this big box at the front door ? __eou__ Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . __eou__ What did you get yourself into ? __eou__ I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months . __eou__ So , what's in the box ? A fridge ? __eou__ It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . __eou__ I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! __eou__ Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ?
How can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend . __eou__ Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? __eou__ She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . __eou__ OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes . __eou__ Which one would you recommend ? __eou__ Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? __eou__ That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . __eou__ Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__ It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy . __eou__ How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick . __eou__ She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . __eou__ How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . __eou__ No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . __eou__ I know what she would like-some whitening cream . __eou__ No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter . __eou__ Will that be all then ? __eou__ That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks .
What did you buy at the market ? __eou__ I bought some special local products . __eou__ You seem to have bought the whole market ! __eou__ Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . __eou__ Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . __eou__ Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? __eou__ All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . __eou__ Then I will buy some tomorrow . __eou__ Why do you want to buy so much ? __eou__ Because I want to send them to my friends . __eou__ I see .
Are there pets allowed in this apartment ? __eou__ No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed . __eou__ What about a boa constrictor ? __eou__ Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ? __eou__ If I had one , could I rent this apartment ? __eou__ I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock . __eou__ What about a Gila monster ? __eou__ I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here .
Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . __eou__ Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? __eou__ I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one . __eou__ You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ? __eou__ I know , I know . I will do it all by myself . __eou__ Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? __eou__ Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . __eou__ Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this .
I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ? __eou__ Sure . Let's buy it .
Help ! I'm about to drop these books . __eou__ I've got them . __eou__ Thanks !
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ? __eou__ I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? __eou__ It's not special . It can be seen everywhere . __eou__ How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . __eou__ It's interesting . Let me see . __eou__ Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , how much is it ? __eou__ Fifty yuan . __eou__ OK , I'll take it .
Where are you going , Tony ? __eou__ It's none of your business . __eou__ Mom said you couldn't go out . __eou__ I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way .
Has someone already helped you ? __eou__ No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot . __eou__ Which do you like best ? __eou__ That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? __eou__ 360 yuan . __eou__ Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here . __eou__ Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock . __eou__ I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? __eou__ I can give you a 10 % discount . __eou__ That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ? __eou__ I'm afraid that's the best we can do . __eou__ If so , I'd better try another store .
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Can I have a look at your handworks ? __eou__ All right . This way , please . __eou__ You have quite a range , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__ They are all produced in China , aren't they ? __eou__ Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . __eou__ Could you please select me one ? __eou__ How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . __eou__ Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? __eou__ 350 yuan . __eou__ OK . I'll take it .
Dad , do you know where Mom is ? __eou__ I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . __eou__ She'd better not start crying like she usually does . __eou__ I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? __eou__ Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . __eou__ I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . __eou__ That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . __eou__ We have great confidence in you .
Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! __eou__ That is a blast from the past . __eou__ Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ? __eou__ Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . __eou__ Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . __eou__ But what are you going to do with that pig ? __eou__ I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money . __eou__ Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation !
Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . __eou__ It still feels really strange to me . __eou__ I know . I miss him terribly . __eou__ How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? __eou__ I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . __eou__ I guess you could choose that if you wanted . __eou__ No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . __eou__ Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone !
We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food . __eou__ Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . __eou__ What should we buy ? __eou__ Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . __eou__ It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . __eou__ How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . __eou__ Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . __eou__ Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? __eou__ That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . __eou__ Definitely beer . Two bottles . __eou__ Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . __eou__ Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . __eou__ OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . __eou__ Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines .
Can I help you ? __eou__ I need some stamps . __eou__ What kind of stamps do you want ? __eou__ How much do I need for this letter ? __eou__ I must weigh it . __eou__ How much ? Is it overweight ? __eou__ It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ? __eou__ How much is it , then ? __eou__ Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all . __eou__ OK . Here you are .
Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? __eou__ Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . __eou__ Wow . You look great . __eou__ Thanks for noticing . __eou__ What type of diet were you on ? __eou__ I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . __eou__ That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? __eou__ Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . __eou__ That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? __eou__ Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . __eou__ That makes sense . I'm going to try that . __eou__ You don't need to lose weight . __eou__ I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . __eou__ Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . __eou__ No problem .
Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? __eou__ I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . __eou__ He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . __eou__ Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . __eou__ How do you propose to help him understand that ? __eou__ Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . __eou__ I guess we could go visit once in a while too . __eou__ Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition .
Oops ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I overcooked the corn . __eou__ That's okay . I like it better that way anyway .
Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . __eou__ No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? __eou__ I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? __eou__ That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . __eou__ He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . __eou__ Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . __eou__ You're glad he saved me , huh ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time !
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . __eou__ Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . __eou__ Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . __eou__ That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . __eou__ What do you know ? You are over weight too . __eou__ I'm not on a diet though . __eou__ I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . __eou__ I like ice cream too much though . __eou__ C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . __eou__ It does sound appealing . __eou__ It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . __eou__ Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . __eou__ Great . I'll get our plan started right away . __eou__ Can we start tomorrow though ?
I need to buy some fruit . __eou__ All the fruit are pretty fresh here . __eou__ How much are the pears ? __eou__ They're four yuan per kilo . __eou__ Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ? __eou__ Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo . __eou__ It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . __eou__ Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . __eou__ OK . It's 22 yuan __eou__ Here you are .
I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . __eou__ Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . __eou__ What's the brand ? __eou__ San Yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? __eou__ I'm not used to other brands . __eou__ You can have a try . Maybe you will like it . __eou__ OK . I hope so .
Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? __eou__ Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . __eou__ Which brand are you interested in ? __eou__ I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? __eou__ Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? __eou__ It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . __eou__ How about Flymo ? It's selling well . __eou__ Do you have a warranty on it ? __eou__ Of course . The warranty period is one year . __eou__ If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? __eou__ Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . __eou__ OK . I'll take one .
Lucy , where are you going ? __eou__ I want to go to the supermarket . __eou__ Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you . __eou__ Let's get a shopping cart . __eou__ Good idea __eou__ What are you going to buy ? __eou__ Let's check out the fruit section first . __eou__ OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet . __eou__ Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . __eou__ I'll take some , too . __eou__ Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets . __eou__ OK . I'll go and buy some cakes . __eou__ Do you want to buy something else ? __eou__ No . Let's go over to the check-out stand .
Mom , I finished . __eou__ OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . __eou__ OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink . __eou__ Thank you . I'll wash them . __eou__ OK . Then I will clean the table . __eou__ Good boy .
I had a busy morning . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I watered all the plants . __eou__ You have a lot of plants . __eou__ Then I did my laundry . __eou__ That takes some time . __eou__ I took the dog for a walk . __eou__ I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . __eou__ I vacuumed the entire house . __eou__ That's a lot of work . __eou__ And then I made lunch . __eou__ I'll bet you were hungry !
My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? __eou__ Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . __eou__ I wish my parents were a little more lenient . __eou__ I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . __eou__ You like going to bed early ? __eou__ I don't like being too tired the next day . __eou__ Well , I still hate having a curfew . __eou__ If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway .
I found a great school for Junior ! __eou__ Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet ! __eou__ We can't be too cautious about these things . __eou__ You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school . __eou__ There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook ! __eou__ What about inside the school ? __eou__ There is a library right inside the front door . __eou__ I think our child is going to love it !
What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? __eou__ We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . __eou__ I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . __eou__ You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours . __eou__ I think she is really going to like her teacher though . __eou__ Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day . __eou__ Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ? __eou__ No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies !
Tom , it's time for you to take a shower . __eou__ Mom , I don't want to bathe today . __eou__ Why ? You can't be always so lazy . __eou__ Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . __eou__ Alright . But you promise this is the last time . __eou__ OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom .

There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . __eou__ You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . __eou__ But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . __eou__ To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue .

We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work .

Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ? __eou__ Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now . __eou__ Do you think any studios will open up soon ? __eou__ No , not for a few months .
What kind of lease is it ? __eou__ It's a one-year lease . __eou__ Can I have a month-to-month lease ? I only want to rent the apartment for five months . __eou__ No , all the leases are for one year . We don't have month-to-month leases . __eou__ Well , then I don't think this would be a good apartment for me . Thank you anyway . __eou__ You're welcome .
Are utilities included in the rent ? __eou__ Gas and water are included . __eou__ Do I have to pay for electricity myself ? __eou__ Yes , electricity is not included in the rent .

You're not fat . __eou__ I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . __eou__ Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . __eou__ I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . __eou__ Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . __eou__ How much do they weigh ? __eou__ All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . __eou__ But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest .

Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? __eou__ Hi , I am just looking . __eou__ It's a good car . __eou__ What year is it ? __eou__ 1999 . __eou__ How about the mileage ? __eou__ 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . __eou__ What do you mean 7B __eou__ Highway miles are not as bad as local miles .

Does this car have a warranty ? __eou__ One month . __eou__ How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? __eou__ You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ $ 5,900 . __eou__ I'll have to think about it . __eou__ Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . __eou__ Okay .
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? __eou__ We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . __eou__ I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . __eou__ You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? __eou__ Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . __eou__ While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . __eou__ We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . __eou__ I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . __eou__ Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . __eou__ No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . __eou__ Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . __eou__ And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? __eou__ Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? __eou__ Four times might be enough . Not once or twice .
Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month . __eou__ Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? __eou__ Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ What did you do for your last move ? __eou__ Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out . __eou__ Oh . that's very nice of him . __eou__ Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . __eou__ Yes , please .
Miss , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . __eou__ It's because of the view . __eou__ Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? __eou__ Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . __eou__ How many elevators are there ? __eou__ There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . __eou__ How about the car-park space ? __eou__ There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . __eou__ Any other facilities ? __eou__ Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . __eou__ What is the completion date ? __eou__ The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . __eou__ How about the price and the bank mortgage ? __eou__ Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . __eou__ How many payment methods are there ? __eou__ It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . __eou__ Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . __eou__ You're welcome .
You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . __eou__ I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . __eou__ Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . __eou__ That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another .
Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? __eou__ I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . __eou__ How often dose this bus go there ? __eou__ Every fifteen minutes . __eou__ I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? __eou__ The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . __eou__ Where can I find the bus ? __eou__ The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome .
What is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . __eou__ I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now .
Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? __eou__ Yes , you're at the right stop . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Are you new here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . __eou__ Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? __eou__ One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . __eou__ I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? __eou__ It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus .
Here we are on the train . __eou__ Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . __eou__ I hear many people have cars . __eou__ Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . __eou__ Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? __eou__ Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . __eou__ I see .
Good coming , sir . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? __eou__ Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going to Wangfujing . __eou__ Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . __eou__ Thank you very much .
How much is the fare ? __eou__ Three yuan . __eou__ Could you tell me how to use it ? __eou__ You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . __eou__ Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? __eou__ That's very easy . The exit is always open . __eou__ Thank you for your help . __eou__ My pleasure .

Can I get that on the Accord ? __eou__ Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . __eou__ Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car . __eou__ You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__ Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . __eou__ Alright , sir .

I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' .

It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled .

I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big .

Can you make a suit for me to order ? __eou__ Certainly . Come and choose the cloth . __eou__ By the way , what's the charge for the tailoring ? __eou__ $ 150 including the cloth .
Waiter , show me the menu , please . __eou__ Yes , here you are .

How is your appetite today ? __eou__ I'm rather hungry now . __eou__ What would you like to have ? __eou__ Please give me a piece of pie first . __eou__ Which would you rather have , beef or chicken ? __eou__ Beef , please . __eou__ How about drinks ?

I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house . __eou__ My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ? __eou__ I know I should , but that place isn't very convenient . You have to wait for a long time . __eou__ Yes I know . I have to do it every week .

There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day . __eou__ Can I take the subway to get there ? __eou__ Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab . __eou__ Won't that be expensive ? __eou__ No , from here I think it's only about 5 dollars .
Did you order the cake ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot . __eou__ Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ Yeah . How about ' Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ' __eou__ I ’ m on it !

Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song . __eou__ What's so special about this song ? __eou__ It's from the musical that is so popular in New York right now . Do you like it ? __eou__ Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me . __eou__ That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation . __eou__ I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited . __eou__ Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ? __eou__ I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz .

I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? __eou__ Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? __eou__ Basically , there are 7 types of games __eou__ Well , I am a beginner . I ... __eou__ Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . __eou__ I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . __eou__ If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . __eou__ Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__ I will have the latest editions .

Let's go .
Have you bought War Craft 2 yet ? __eou__ Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ It's a great game .

I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over .

It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . __eou__ What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? __eou__ Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . __eou__ Faulty products ? __eou__ Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . __eou__ Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . __eou__ Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__ That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . __eou__ Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . __eou__ Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . __eou__ How many do you want to buy ? __eou__ I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? __eou__ You're right .
Have you any beef today ? __eou__ Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . __eou__ How much is it a pound ? __eou__ One pound and fifty pence a pound . __eou__ Good . I'll get three pounds of it . __eou__ Here it is . Four pounds and fifty pence in all .
Have you got some nice apples in stock today ? __eou__ What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . __eou__ Are they sweet ? __eou__ Very sweet . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each . __eou__ All right , I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones . __eou__ OK . Anything else ? __eou__ Do you have any tangerines ? I'd like to have two kilograms . __eou__ Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . __eou__ How much is it in all ? __eou__ Thirty dollars .
What is your policy on returns ? __eou__ If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__ That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? __eou__ Charge . Here's my card . __eou__ Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . __eou__ Thank you .
I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . __eou__ Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit . __eou__ Not really . It pinches my toes . __eou__ I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . __eou__ I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . __eou__ Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you .

Do you have a special location in mind ? __eou__ I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . __eou__ When would you like to move in ? __eou__ As soon as possible . __eou__ How about the end of this month ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? __eou__ I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . __eou__ Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . __eou__ Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . __eou__ That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it .
Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? __eou__ You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . __eou__ Do you charge for delivery ? __eou__ Wo will deliver the goods to you for free . __eou__ Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? __eou__ Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . __eou__ OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? __eou__ No later than tomorrow . __eou__ Thanks .
Good evening , sir . __eou__ Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . __eou__ Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? __eou__ On the rocks , please .
Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . __eou__ Boy , you are lost . It's across town . __eou__ Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? __eou__ You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there .
What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . __eou__ That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now !
I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . __eou__ I said , " Do you want me to help you ? " __eou__ If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . __eou__ OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ?

I'm about to explode ! __eou__ Are you still mad at her now ? __eou__ To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done . __eou__ Will you apologize to her ? __eou__ No way . It ’ s her who should apologize .

Is this the right bus for San Francisco ? __eou__ It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine . __eou__ When's the first stop ? __eou__ About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Is it all right to smoke on the bus ? __eou__ Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed . __eou__ I see . Thank you .
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__ Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__ Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__ How much did she ask for ? __eou__ Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . '
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__ cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__ yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . __eou__ is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . __eou__ but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__ of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .
Is your father in the habit of having naps ? __eou__ Yes , all of us have naps . __eou__ Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? __eou__ No , not at all .
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure .
Are you ready , Pa ? __eou__ In a second . Have you got a torch ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Here it is . Let's go .
Let's see if we forget anything . __eou__ Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . __eou__ Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . __eou__ All right .
Do you like the cookies ? __eou__ I finished them in no time . __eou__ Glad you like it . __eou__ Mum , when will we have them again ?
What's your weight . __eou__ 150 pounds . __eou__ Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__ I can't bear eating less .
your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__ Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise . __eou__ By the way , do you work out ? __eou__ No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__ Fine .
Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? __eou__ No.Why ? __eou__ Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . __eou__ Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day .
I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . __eou__ Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . __eou__ You've formed a sound habit . __eou__ I think so , too .
Excuse me , ma'am ? __eou__ Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me .
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? __eou__ I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__ Aren't you tired ? __eou__ No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? __eou__ It was okay . __eou__ Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No thanks , I'm not thirsty . __eou__ Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? __eou__ Yes I did . __eou__ Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? __eou__ Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual .
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday . __eou__ Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? __eou__ Yes , that would be good ! __eou__ We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? __eou__ If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . __eou__ You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? __eou__ Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . __eou__ Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . __eou__ Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . __eou__ Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift .
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . __eou__ A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .
Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' .
I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . __eou__ We have some fresh red roses . __eou__ How much are the roses ? __eou__ Twenty dollars per dozen . __eou__ That sounds like a good deal . __eou__ Yes , that is today's sale price . __eou__ I'll take a dozen . __eou__ Is there anything else you'd like to get ? __eou__ No , the roses will be fine . __eou__ I'm sure your wife will love them .
What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet !
Traffic rules are different among countries . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ People drive on the right in China . __eou__ Oh , that's interesting !
How can we avoid the jam ? __eou__ Let's take a roundabout way . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Look , traffic jam again !
Usually cities have greater traffic problems . __eou__ Of course , there're too many people . __eou__ I hate the car columns on the road . __eou__ But we couldn't help it .
I can't find proper parking space . __eou__ Let's just park here . __eou__ No , there's no parking sign . __eou__ Oh , the policeman's coming .
John , it ’ s time to get up . __eou__ It can ’ t be time to get up yet . __eou__ It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__ What ’ s the time ? __eou__ It ’ s nearly half past seven . __eou__ My watch says ten past . __eou__ It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__ Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__ Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . __eou__ ( And here is the seven o ’ clock news ) It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . __eou__ I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
This is the rush hour . __eou__ I notice there's a jam a few blocks away . __eou__ Let's drive off this road . __eou__ I'm afraid I'll be late .
Why do you stop me ? __eou__ You have gone against the traffic rules . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ Do you know this is a Onaway street ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ You have to pay a fine .
Shit , so crowded ! __eou__ The radio said it's OK on this road . __eou__ Things change every minute . __eou__ We have too many cars !
How long do I have to wait ? __eou__ Two hours.That area is a little backward . __eou__ I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities . __eou__ You're right .
What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking __eou__ There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__ It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
Do you like shopping ? __eou__ Yeah . I go shopping once a week __eou__ Why don't you do your shopping at home ? __eou__ What do you mean ? I can't understand . __eou__ I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . __eou__ Really ? That's unbelievable .
Oh , here comes a bus ! __eou__ It's here at last ! __eou__ How long have you waited ? __eou__ Twenty minutes exactly .
I'll be late because I have waited so long ! __eou__ Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon . __eou__ I'd better take a taxi . __eou__ That's no use.This is morning rush hour .
Oh , the bus is gone . __eou__ Pity we didn't catch it . __eou__ I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . __eou__ We have to wait six more minutes !
Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? __eou__ Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted . __eou__ Have you ever seen such a nice house ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new . __eou__ It's great !
My dear , it's five flights up ! __eou__ That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . __eou__ We're little further away from the street and traffic noise __eou__ And there's no one living over us . __eou__ Is the place well-furnished ? __eou__ Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . __eou__ What about the kitchen ? __eou__ The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , __eou__ And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . __eou__ Are the plumbing all right ? __eou__ The plumbing seems OK , too . __eou__ The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water __eou__ And the sinks don't seem to leak . __eou__ The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again .
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . __eou__ You're so careless , Billy . __eou__ Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . __eou__ I've done it for you .
My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? __eou__ An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? __eou__ Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__ Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__ That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__ That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__ Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__ That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__ 256MB . __eou__ Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .
George , did you remember to buy me the book ? __eou__ Sorry , darling , I forgot . __eou__ When will you buy it then ? __eou__ I promise you'll have it tomorrow .
Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ? __eou__ Sure , Mum.In a minute . __eou__ Here's the money.And get some salt . __eou__ Yes , Mum .
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ No , I'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ Don't make a fuss.The price is rising
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? __eou__ I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . __eou__ What do you think is the biggest change ? __eou__ Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . __eou__ That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . __eou__ Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? __eou__ I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . __eou__ That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! __eou__ How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? __eou__ Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . __eou__ I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? __eou__ They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .
Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? __eou__ Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? __eou__ First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . __eou__ How can you get that done ? __eou__ Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . __eou__ What else ? __eou__ Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? __eou__ That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__ Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . __eou__ Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__ OK , I'll take it .
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__ Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited . __eou__ He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__ And the host announced that he won it all !
Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? __eou__ Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . __eou__ Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . __eou__ The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . __eou__ I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public .
Do you have any apartment to rent ? __eou__ Yes . Right now I have a studio . __eou__ Where is it . __eou__ In the downtown , near the square . __eou__ Is it furnished ? __eou__ Yes , and the rent includes utilities . __eou__ That's good . When can I go to see the house ? __eou__ What about next saturday . __eou__ Fine .
Excuse me , where am I on this map ? __eou__ You're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . __eou__ Which bus should I take to railway station ? __eou__ You can take a No . 2 bus here . __eou__ Where am I supposed to change ? __eou__ At Longing Street .
Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . __eou__ Great . Where is it ? __eou__ A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . __eou__ What about the surrounding area ? __eou__ Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants . __eou__ That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? __eou__ Yeah , it's near a bus stop . __eou__ Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then .
Have you ever thought about your ideal home ? __eou__ I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__ What would it be like ? __eou__ Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__ How many rooms would it have ? __eou__ I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . __eou__ How many bathrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ How would you decorate your house ? __eou__ I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . __eou__ How many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .
We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . __eou__ Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out . __eou__ Let's see . We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month . __eou__ That's $ 1 825 . __eou__ We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . __eou__ $ 3 075 . Our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 . __eou__ Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ? __eou__ Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . __eou__ All right .
Excuse me , can you tell me where central Park Street is ? __eou__ Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ No . It's only a ten-minute walk . __eou__ I see . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome .
Excuse me , where is the nearest bank ? __eou__ There is one next to the post office , round the corner . __eou__ Thank you .
Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? __eou__ Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ No , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . __eou__ Thank you .
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm not really that interested in those things . __eou__ They are very nice , you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh . I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody's buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion . There are so many other really important things in the world .
Excuse me , Is there a hotel nearby ? __eou__ The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . __eou__ how can I get there ? __eou__ just walk down this road and you'll find it . it's on the right side .
This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ? __eou__ Yes , of course.The dressing room is over there .
Can I help you ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm just looking .
Hello , may I speak to Kevin , please ? __eou__ Speaking .
Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate . __eou__ I ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? __eou__ It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
How much is this shirt , please ? __eou__ It's 89 yuan . __eou__ Do you have it in a larger size ? __eou__ Let me check .
Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ? __eou__ Yes , this is the right bus . __eou__ Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ? __eou__ Don't worry . I'll call out the stops . __eou__ ( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ? __eou__ No , don't worry . I'll get you off when you get there . __eou__ Is it a long ride ? __eou__ No , not that long . Two more stops , and you'll get off , sir . __eou__ OK . I know . Thank you . __eou__ Not at all .
Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ Of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ Has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know .
Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? __eou__ A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . __eou__ Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . __eou__ Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . __eou__ I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon . __eou__ Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure .
Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ Steven , are you talking to me ? __eou__ Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? __eou__ I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . __eou__ Did someone get hurt ? __eou__ A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . __eou__ What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? __eou__ I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . __eou__ Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? __eou__ I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool .
Hello ! Is your taxi engaged ? __eou__ No , this taxi is free . __eou__ Please take me to the Honging Hotel . __eou__ OK . Please get in . I'm glad to serve you . __eou__ Could you get there in twenty minutes ? __eou__ It will take half an hour to get to the hotel . __eou__ I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . I have a friend waiting for me . __eou__ OK , I promise we'll get there in twenty minutes . __eou__ Thanks .
It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ What kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ Ok , let's go then ! __eou__ Do you have any money ? __eou__ For what ? __eou__ For our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ You said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ I should have known ...
How is your house hunting going ? __eou__ Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ How much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! __eou__ How long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . __eou__ Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ No , I thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ I don't think I can afford that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .
How do I get to the post office from school ? __eou__ Turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom . __eou__ OK , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__ You are welcome . Hope you can find it soon .
What's your apartment like ? __eou__ It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ What is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ Did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ How long is your contract for ? __eou__ That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ Have you started looking yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ Good luck !
Steven , what's the expense of moving house ? __eou__ About 3 000 dollars . __eou__ It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? __eou__ I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . __eou__ We have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__ Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income . __eou__ I hope so .
How far is it from here to the airport ? __eou__ It ’ s about an hour ’ s drive . __eou__ I need to get there before ten.Can we make it ? __eou__ I can ’ t promise , but I ’ ll do my best .
Julia , I have good news for you . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ I have earned a lot of money this week , more than I do in a fortnight . __eou__ It is really good news . How much do you earn a week now ? __eou__ My wages are six hundred dollars a week . But I find a part-time job to supplement my income . __eou__ Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important . __eou__ I know , darling . I must earn enough money to buy a car . I do a part-time job to increase my income . Don't worry , I will take care of myself . __eou__ I see . You must have more rest .
Hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ That depends . What is it ? __eou__ It's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ? __eou__ I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ If you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . __eou__ Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ That'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__ How about at 6 pm ? __eou__ See you then !

We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! __eou__ Let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? __eou__ What would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? __eou__ I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . __eou__ Well , let's get a plate of those then . __eou__ Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? __eou__ I think I might have a dahl . __eou__ What's in a dahl ? __eou__ It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . __eou__ That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__ Ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? __eou__ That's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__ I think I'll have a beer . __eou__ Ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . __eou__ You're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! __eou__ What would you do without me ?
This shirt is really nice . __eou__ You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ? __eou__ OK . I'll try on a medium size . __eou__ Here you are __eou__ Where is the fitting room ? __eou__ It's just around the comer . __eou__ It's too big tor me . Do you have a smaller one ? __eou__ Yes .

I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . __eou__ All right . I will get them for you .

Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . __eou__ Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? __eou__ Uh , no .

Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? __eou__ Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . __eou__ It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . __eou__ So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? __eou__ I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . __eou__ And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? __eou__ Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__ But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . __eou__ They're much better __eou__ But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . __eou__ That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . __eou__ Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . __eou__ I suppose so .

Are you interested in mountaineering ? __eou__ Yes . in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ? __eou__ I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . __eou__ How did you spend the night there ? __eou__ We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow !

It's very famous in China , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains . __eou__ I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? __eou__ I'd love to .
What do you think of this flat ? __eou__ It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us . __eou__ Small , but it should be enough for our needs . I think . __eou__ But there's no hot water after 10 at night . Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed . especially in the winter . It feels good . __eou__ That's true . But I love the living room ; it's huge and filled with sunshine . __eou__ True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped . __eou__ It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__ You're right . The view is spectacular . But that bedroom is so small . We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__ Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff . __eou__ I haven't thought of that .
You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . __eou__ It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable !
Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . __eou__ Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . __eou__ To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too . __eou__ Yes , and he also ... __eou__ Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ? __eou__ Probably not . After all he is our teacher . We should try to find something nice to say . If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all . __eou__ I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now . __eou__ All right . I want to take a shower first , I ’ m exhausted .
Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? __eou__ Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket . __eou__ Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories . __eou__ I like this jacket . Can I try it on ? __eou__ Of course . The changing rooms are over there . __eou__ Thanks .

Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ? __eou__ Certainly . What kind of novel did you have in mind ? __eou__ I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . __eou__ Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . __eou__ Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either . __eou__ That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? __eou__ Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now . __eou__ There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend . __eou__ I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else . __eou__ How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . __eou__ Don't mention it .

Excuse me , I ’ d like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one ? __eou__ Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ? __eou__ An acoustic one . __eou__ Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ? __eou__ What ’ s the difference ? __eou__ Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking .

It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play . __eou__ Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well . __eou__ You should also get a couple of guitar picks . __eou__ Oh , right.Thanks for your help . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it .

Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ? __eou__ Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more .

Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... I'll think about it . __eou__ well , I think you should come and have some fun . Besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . You should at least try .
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
It's getting late , Mary . __eou__ Maybe I should go home . __eou__ Why don't you sleep over ? __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ We can sleep together . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . __eou__ Don't forget to call your host mother to tell her . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me .
Hello , May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . __eou__ Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . __eou__ That is exactly what we're looking for . __eou__ Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . __eou__ That sounds all right to us . __eou__ When do you want to move in ? __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Fine , I'll be expecting you . __eou__ See you tomorrow .
Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ Haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . __eou__ Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time .
What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? __eou__ Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable .
Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper . __eou__ He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . __eou__ Thanks for the warning . __eou__ That's all right .
I want to leave home , mum . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I am a grown-up , and I can stand on my own two feet . __eou__ It is all up to you .

But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
Shall we have some soup first ? __eou__ No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . __eou__ Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have , fish or meat ? __eou__ Meat , I think . __eou__ Don't you like fish then ? __eou__ I do , but I want meat . __eou__ Shall we have some white wine then ? __eou__ Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . __eou__ What would you like for dessert ? __eou__ I just want to have a coffee , I think . __eou__ Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired .
Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ? __eou__ No , I'll have the fish please . __eou__ The chicken is also nice . __eou__ No , I want the fish . __eou__ Our special tonight is lobster . __eou__ Thank you , but I prefer the fish . __eou__ Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb . __eou__ No , I'd like the fish . __eou__ Whatever you say .
Sally , what do we have for dinner __eou__ What would you like to have ? __eou__ Well , I quit breakfast , so I had a rich brunch .

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__ I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
Do you take in students ? __eou__ Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ 30.00 dollars a week . __eou__ Do you think I could have a look at it , please . __eou__ I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ?

Don ’ t be angry with them . After all , they are still children . __eou__ But I am still worry about them . I ’ m afraid ... __eou__ If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track . __eou__ Well , I won ’ t put a crime into their doings .

If you want a new camera , go and earn money yourself .
I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? __eou__ Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit . __eou__ But each children has his own interest . __eou__ Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision .
Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . __eou__ The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . __eou__ But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__ Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside .
Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . __eou__ I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? __eou__ I think you are flicking through it . __eou__ Well , wait a minute .
Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . __eou__ It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . __eou__ Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . __eou__ I hope so .

Why didn ’ t you call me last night ? __eou__ Because I went out . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ? __eou__ I didn ’ t have any change . __eou__ Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then . __eou__ I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why .
Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . __eou__ I'm OK . __eou__ I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? __eou__ Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . __eou__ OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! __eou__ First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ Oh , OK . Wow ! __eou__ OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ Wow . That sounds really good .
Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . __eou__ I feel kind of stupid . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . __eou__ You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__ No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__ You could have called . __eou__ I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__ You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__ Guess where we ended up . __eou__ I don't know . Where ? __eou__ When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . __eou__ Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__ I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__ Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__ I know it is . I don't know how it happened . __eou__ Hmm , maybe I do . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Maybe I have an idea how it happened . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__ Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
What's the matter , Paul ? __eou__ Can you believe this ? I locked my keys in the car , and I have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt . __eou__ So , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon . __eou__ Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there . __eou__ Sure . That's no problem . __eou__ Oh , and Andy ? Do you have a quarter for the phone ? My wallet's in the car . __eou__ Here you go .

Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? __eou__ Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over .

How can you forget about it ? __eou__ My dear , tomorrow is our wedding anniversary . We've been together for 20 years . But you never change . Always so careless ! Do you remember the thing that happened on our wedding day ? __eou__ Of course . I almost missed my own wedding . __eou__ Yeah .

Our old place turns into a brand new place . __eou__ Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift . __eou__ I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . __eou__ Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . __eou__ You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job .
Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . __eou__ I'm OK . __eou__ OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before .

Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ Wow . That sounds really good . __eou__ Mm , it is . __eou__ Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? __eou__ Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese .

How big is this parking lot in our community ? __eou__ It has fifty parking spaces . __eou__ So you guys should be always busy . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I bet it is always full of cars . __eou__ Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . __eou__ Ah ...

Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival .

The tea smells good . What tea is it ? __eou__ It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . __eou__ What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? __eou__ You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . __eou__ They must have some special methods to do this during the process . __eou__ Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . __eou__ Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? __eou__ Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . __eou__ What's the advantage about tea ? __eou__ There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . __eou__ Does that mean the stronger the better ? __eou__ No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . __eou__ Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? __eou__ It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold .
Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? __eou__ Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . __eou__ Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? __eou__ You should open an account at the online bank first .

Second-hand cellphone store ? __eou__ Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . __eou__ Really ? How to do that ? __eou__ Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction . __eou__ That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? __eou__ Let's click to check it out . __eou__ Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . __eou__ No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits . __eou__ Are there any disadvantages about it ? __eou__ It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon .
Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? __eou__ Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . __eou__ Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . __eou__ Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . __eou__ Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? __eou__ Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . __eou__ Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? __eou__ You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . __eou__ I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? __eou__ There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . __eou__ Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . __eou__ It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? __eou__ I'll take care of the order . __eou__ OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ? __eou__ Don't forget about the dessert . __eou__ OK , then 50 Yuan for dessert . 500 Yuan all together .

So they can always make you look amazing . __eou__ I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? __eou__ Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . __eou__ It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . __eou__ Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? __eou__ Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! __eou__ Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__ Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . __eou__ It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__ That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? __eou__ No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . __eou__ How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . __eou__ I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .

Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . __eou__ What kind of presents do you want ? __eou__ Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? __eou__ OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . __eou__ Hey , How did you know I came from America ? __eou__ Just a hunch , sir . __eou__ How much again ? __eou__ $ 59.95 . __eou__ That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . __eou__ Sorry , sir . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . __eou__ Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . __eou__ That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . __eou__ DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ? __eou__ It's $ 60 here . __eou__ That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? __eou__ Of course not , sir . __eou__ OK , I'll take one .
I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . __eou__ I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . __eou__ Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . __eou__ We are nor alone here . So many other families ! __eou__ Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . __eou__ Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . __eou__ OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . __eou__ Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? __eou__ Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . __eou__ Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? __eou__ He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . __eou__ Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . __eou__ Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic ! __eou__ I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world . __eou__ I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day . __eou__ Well , OK . you are always right .
I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . __eou__ My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? __eou__ Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . __eou__ What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . __eou__ That was last time . This time it's worse . __eou__ Ok , tell me . __eou__ Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... __eou__ And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . __eou__ True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... __eou__ Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . __eou__ And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . __eou__ At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . __eou__ Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . __eou__ Hmm , that is bad .
Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . __eou__ I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . __eou__ I am going there , too . We can walk together . __eou__ Sure .
Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ? __eou__ Lily , I ’ m not sure . Let me check , I think I spent $ 50 . __eou__ Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . __eou__ I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I guess I ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank . __eou__ That ’ s okay . I ’ m sorry , too . It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities .
Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ? __eou__ I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot . __eou__ Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn . __eou__ Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ? __eou__ I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola . __eou__ Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional . __eou__ Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ? __eou__ The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ? __eou__ Sure . Is it sweet ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too . __eou__ Great , I want it spicy . __eou__ Come on . Don's go too far . __eou__ I want it to be special . And you know that I always like hot food . __eou__ OK then . We shall ask them to put some red chilli on it .
Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . __eou__ It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . __eou__ Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . __eou__ I hope so .
What ? Your golden watch is lost ? __eou__ Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . __eou__ It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . __eou__ Let's get it back .
Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . __eou__ You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . __eou__ Are you serious ? How can that be ? __eou__ Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . __eou__ Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . __eou__ That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! __eou__ Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! __eou__ You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__ Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__ Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . __eou__ What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . __eou__ Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . __eou__ Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . __eou__ Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . __eou__ Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .
Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? __eou__ Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . __eou__ OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific . __eou__ Of course . It's a newly-built one . __eou__ We are lucky to play in a new stadium . __eou__ Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . __eou__ Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . __eou__ Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? __eou__ Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . __eou__ Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . __eou__ No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . __eou__ Really ? You must be ... __eou__ But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . __eou__ That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . __eou__ Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . __eou__ He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor .
Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? __eou__ There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . __eou__ Trust me . I've been driving for two years . __eou__ Ok . You drive and do be careful .
What can I do ? __eou__ The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet . __eou__ Did you go to any illegal website ? __eou__ No , But does that matter ? __eou__ Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . __eou__ I see . I'd better never try . __eou__ That's wise . __eou__ Do you know what's wrong with my PC ? __eou__ One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . __eou__ Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ? __eou__ Of course . You'd better learn something about it . __eou__ I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ? __eou__ Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that .
Daniel , here is some money for the tickets . __eou__ OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? __eou__ Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . __eou__ But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . __eou__ They may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . __eou__ Dad , it makes no sense . __eou__ You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . __eou__ Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan .
I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first . __eou__ Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? __eou__ Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . __eou__ OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move . __eou__ How much will it cost in that case ? __eou__ Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please . __eou__ Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving . __eou__ No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving . __eou__ The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ? __eou__ OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department .
Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . __eou__ I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . __eou__ They spend hours there , especially on weekends . __eou__ Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ Isn't that complicated ? __eou__ No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . __eou__ We ? Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ Sure . I love going to the mall . __eou__ What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?
Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . __eou__ I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . __eou__ A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . __eou__ Here ’ s an interesting ad __eou__ How much is the rent ? __eou__ The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . __eou__ When is the place available ? __eou__ It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work .
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . __eou__ Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
Can you tell me how to reach the bank please ? __eou__ Which bank ? There are two , the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland . __eou__ I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank . __eou__ You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre , Dunned Stores . __eou__ How do I get there . I have no knowledge of this area . __eou__ Cross the road and turn left at the other side . Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left . __eou__ It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ? __eou__ It's not so complicated . It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish . __eou__ Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ? __eou__ You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area .
This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . __eou__ That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ? __eou__ Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly . __eou__ How long will it take ? __eou__ It depends . __eou__ I need to talk it over with my wife . __eou__ Certainly .

So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? __eou__ It ’ s $ 240 a month . __eou__ Does that include utilities ? __eou__ It includes water , but not gas and electricity . __eou__ That ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work . __eou__ Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first . __eou__ All right ! Thank you .

Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . __eou__ Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? __eou__ Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . __eou__ Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? __eou__ Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile . __eou__ Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? __eou__ I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . __eou__ Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? __eou__ Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they .

But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__ I guess you are right . __eou__ Believe me . Everything will be ok . __eou__ I hope so .

It's a long trip to work every day . __eou__ How are you going to find an apartment ? __eou__ I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . __eou__ Apartments in the city are expensive . __eou__ I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . __eou__ Well , only you liked it really , darling . __eou__ Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? __eou__ No , I assure you . __eou__ And you'll repair the television , won't you ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__ Do you promise ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? __eou__ I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . __eou__ But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? __eou__ Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . __eou__ Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! __eou__ Ok . I'll keep my promise .
Hi . You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . What would you like me to do ? __eou__ Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler . __eou__ Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV ! __eou__ After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it . __eou__ Which spices are you going to add to the meat ? __eou__ These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . __eou__ Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ? __eou__ Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ Right . What are you doing over there ? __eou__ I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe !
Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? __eou__ Promise you are not going to be angry ? __eou__ Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? __eou__ I forgot . __eou__ You forgot ? You ... __eou__ Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
Did you promise me to get the bread ? __eou__ Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . __eou__ But you forgot to get the bread . __eou__ I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . __eou__ Well , I certainly did . __eou__ What would you let me do now ? __eou__ You are free . You can go now . __eou__ Really ? You are so kind . __eou__ I'll do with the cake . __eou__ No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal .
Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! __eou__ I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__ Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . __eou__ So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? __eou__ Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . __eou__ Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__ No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__ You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .
Good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . __eou__ Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . __eou__ When did it first break down ? __eou__ About ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . __eou__ Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . __eou__ Yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ’ s in use . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ Part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? __eou__ Yes , but it's quite a ways . __eou__ Do I need to take a bus ? __eou__ This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . __eou__ How do I get there on foot ? __eou__ Go straight ahead through the intersection . __eou__ Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready . __eou__ Keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third . __eou__ Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? __eou__ Keep walking and look for a tall building . __eou__ Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? __eou__ The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome .
So can you fix it ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . __eou__ What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! __eou__ Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! __eou__ OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? __eou__ Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . __eou__ I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! __eou__ This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back !
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ What about all these other pieces ? __eou__ See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__ That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation !

Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! __eou__ What did I do ?

And you'd better stop talking . __eou__ I don't need your help , jerk . __eou__ Whatever you say .
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? __eou__ Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__ Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening !
Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! __eou__ I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ?

We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . __eou__ I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . __eou__ Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . __eou__ Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ?
Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? __eou__ Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . __eou__ Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? __eou__ Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . __eou__ Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . __eou__ You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! __eou__ You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ? __eou__ You ’ re so picky sometimes . __eou__ Here you go , honey , fried eggs . __eou__ Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .

Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . __eou__ You look a little lost , can I help you ? __eou__ Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . __eou__ Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties . Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . __eou__ Sure that ’ s fine . __eou__ This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? __eou__ Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? __eou__ Just pick something and get the hell out of here .

Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control !
Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? __eou__ The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . __eou__ Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? __eou__ There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there . __eou__ Are the reports favorable ? __eou__ Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak Japanese . __eou__ That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? __eou__ Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . __eou__ I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . __eou__ Sure . There you are .
I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . __eou__ I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . __eou__ I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . __eou__ Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? __eou__ I smoke around 30 each day . __eou__ Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . __eou__ If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . __eou__ Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . __eou__ I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . __eou__ Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet .
What do we need for the barbecue ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties . __eou__ I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__ I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up ! __eou__ And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . __eou__ They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes . __eou__ I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce . __eou__ I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop . __eou__ How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? __eou__ It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . __eou__ They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it . __eou__ I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians !
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ? __eou__ I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . __eou__ You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . __eou__ So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . __eou__ Italian , Indian , and Chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice . __eou__ Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? __eou__ Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . __eou__ How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ? __eou__ Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? __eou__ We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef . You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , we do .

If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you . __eou__ That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine .
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__ Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play . __eou__ It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .

They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__ He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . __eou__ The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! __eou__ Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! __eou__ How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag !

Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . __eou__ Why is it relatively expensive ? __eou__ Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . __eou__ I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . __eou__ We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . __eou__ Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__ A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables .

It ’ s really large . __eou__ Are the rooms nice and bright ? __eou__ Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . __eou__ Do you have a balcony ? __eou__ No , we don ’ t . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . __eou__ You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? __eou__ It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ?
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__ You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ I drink a lot of wine . __eou__ If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ I often feel so tired . __eou__ You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .
Mum , can I finish my homework later ? __eou__ Sorry . You know the rules . __eou__ But I want to watch TV now . __eou__ That ’ s out of the question . __eou__ Please . __eou__ Not a chance . __eou__ Not even for an hour ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s impossible .
Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is . __eou__ Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment . __eou__ Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair . __eou__ Does he have a moustache or a beard ? __eou__ Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . __eou__ Sounds like Mike , is it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know . __eou__ Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are . __eou__ Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that . __eou__ Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree . __eou__ I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information . __eou__ She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too . __eou__ This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is . __eou__ She ’ s your mother ! __eou__ How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? __eou__ I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . __eou__ I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality . __eou__ Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me !
Shall we have some soup first ? __eou__ No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . __eou__ Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? __eou__ Meat , I think . __eou__ Don't you like fish then ? __eou__ I do , but I want meat . __eou__ Shall we have some white wine then ? __eou__ Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . __eou__ What would you like for dessert ? __eou__ I just want to have a coffee , I think . __eou__ Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired .
You say he was around average hight . __eou__ Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . __eou__ Weight ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . __eou__ Any marks on his face ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Glasses ? __eou__ No . __eou__ what about his hair ? __eou__ Black or dark brown . __eou__ Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? __eou__ Straight , I think , and about average length . __eou__ Boy , this surely doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . __eou__ Well , he had a jacked or a plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear . __eou__ Ok , now we are getting some where . Pants ? __eou__ Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . __eou__ What kind of shoes ? __eou__ Boots __eou__ Cow while Boots . __eou__ No , hiking boots . Brown ones . __eou__ All right . That Nealy done a little . __eou__ Now I want you to look some pictures .
There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . __eou__ Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . __eou__ I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound . __eou__ Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . __eou__ That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . __eou__ Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration .
Yes , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ Please I'd like a ticket to New York . __eou__ For today ? __eou__ No , early saturday morning . __eou__ We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ? __eou__ Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty . __eou__ I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . __eou__ No , exactly not . __eou__ How about afternoon ? __eou__ Sounds not good . I won't take it .
Excuse me , sir ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ I'm afraid you can't smoke here . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Can't you see the notes here ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . __eou__ It says ' No smoking ' . __eou__ Sorry , I'm very near sighted .
Are you going out again ? __eou__ Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . __eou__ You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . __eou__ Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? __eou__ No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . __eou__ Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . __eou__ OK . Here's the key . Take care . __eou__ I will . Thank you , dad .
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__ You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ Where it is ? __eou__ It's a private garden .
I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock . __eou__ Oh , yes , Mrs.Saxton . Please take a seat here . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Would you like a shampoo first ? __eou__ Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff . __eou__ Yeah . A lot of my customers love it . ( after shampooing ) Do you want a permanent wave or a cold wave ? __eou__ I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time . __eou__ Sure . We just got some . They're upto-date . __eou__ I prefer this kind of style . Can you make it for me ? __eou__ No problem .
Good morning . Do I need an appointment ? __eou__ No , ma'am , there's only one person ahead of you . You won't have to wait long . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ All right , madam , it's your turn . What will it be today ? __eou__ I've been wearing my hair long for years , but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style . What do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ? __eou__ Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable . __eou__ I hope so . I'm really tired of this old-fashioned style that I've been wearing . __eou__ Would you like me to blow-dry your hair ? __eou__ Yes , if you think it will help . __eou__ What do you think of it ? __eou__ It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? __eou__ Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ? __eou__ By all means .
I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . __eou__ Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? __eou__ I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . __eou__ I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . __eou__ Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . __eou__ Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting .
I come to try my new suit . Here's the receipt . __eou__ Yes , please wait a minute . I'll fetch it for you . Here it is . Please try it on and take a look at the mirror . How do you like it ? __eou__ Aren't the trousers a little too long ? __eou__ If you think so , we'll shorten the legs a bit . It'll take about twenty minutes . __eou__ Very well . Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome , sir .
Miss , where do you want to go ? __eou__ Could you drop me off at the airport ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? __eou__ Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . __eou__ All right .
Shall we share a taxi ? __eou__ Where are you heading now ? __eou__ I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road .

Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? __eou__ Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! __eou__ What sort of pest are we dealing with ? __eou__ We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! __eou__ Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it . Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days . __eou__ No problem , just get rid of the bugs !
I want to go try on these clothes . __eou__ What did you find ? __eou__ I found some jeans , and a new blouse . __eou__ Go and try it on . __eou__ What do you think ? __eou__ I love that shirt on you . __eou__ What about the jeans ? __eou__ They don't really fit you right . __eou__ I don't think so either . __eou__ That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you . __eou__ I'll just buy the shirt . __eou__ That would be a good idea .
Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . __eou__ No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? __eou__ It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? __eou__ That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ?
I am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . I was wondering about the size . __eou__ It's a small . __eou__ How is the condition ? How old is it ? __eou__ It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it . __eou__ Why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ? __eou__ I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you !
Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . __eou__ Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? __eou__ Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . __eou__ That's the beauty of it , and the danger . __eou__ I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . __eou__ How much ? __eou__ Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck .
Ouch ! The water's too hot ! __eou__ Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . __eou__ I'm not hungry , Mom . __eou__ I know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . You'll get too weak if you don't eat . __eou__ Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? __eou__ That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ?
Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . __eou__ My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . __eou__ No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping . __eou__ That's another one thousand six hundred ? __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door .
You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! __eou__ Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . __eou__ That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . __eou__ Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! __eou__ Come on baby , let's dance ! __eou__ Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down !
Sorry to bother you so early . There's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but I thought I'd ask you first . __eou__ That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . __eou__ I thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . So why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details . __eou__ OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ? __eou__ Great . See you then .
Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days . __eou__ Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water . __eou__ Sounds a little weak . __eou__ Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . __eou__ Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . __eou__ Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time .
Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ? __eou__ Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again . __eou__ I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign . __eou__ As long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , I'll be alright for a while . You got your espresso , Jess ?
Balista , I'll have a frappuccino . __eou__ What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ... __eou__ You and your fancy Italian names . __eou__ Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini . __eou__ I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much . __eou__ And I'll stick with real coffee .
This motor oil case is still really slippery . __eou__ Yeah , time for more coffee ! __eou__ Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too . __eou__ By the way , I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ?
This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . __eou__ Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room . __eou__ You never know when two might turn into three . __eou__ I guess you're right . And we'd like to have company anyway . __eou__ Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms . __eou__ Now that's a plus !
So the apartment comes unfurnished ? __eou__ This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture . __eou__ We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners . __eou__ This building is only four years old . It was built with central air . __eou__ Just like in the States ! That's perfect ! __eou__ And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see .
Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ... __eou__ Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets . __eou__ Blow my nose ? __eou__ Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster . __eou__ No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater ! __eou__ It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it !
Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home . __eou__ And the downstairs neighbors ? __eou__ Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor . __eou__ Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then .
Morning , Mom . __eou__ I made a doctor's appointment for you . __eou__ No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor . __eou__ Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school . __eou__ OK . I'll go see the doctor . __eou__ Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup . __eou__ Chicken soup again ? __eou__ Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather .
This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! __eou__ Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup . __eou__ OK , OK . __eou__ And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again . __eou__ Maybe I'll run away first . __eou__ Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine !
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? __eou__ I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . __eou__ I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! __eou__ I'm doing my best , Grandma ... __eou__ Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! __eou__ Uh-oh , here we go ...
Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . __eou__ I know , Grandma , I just ... __eou__ You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! __eou__ Yes'm . __eou__ You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! __eou__ And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! __eou__ Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! __eou__ You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? __eou__ I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! __eou__ Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? __eou__ Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . __eou__ You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here !
Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later !
Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ? __eou__ Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole . __eou__ I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . __eou__ Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ? __eou__ Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__ Would you like anything to drink ? __eou__ Sure , I ' ll have a Corona .
Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? __eou__ “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” __eou__ Trev , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! __eou__ Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . __eou__ No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei .
I found it at a garage sale once . __eou__ What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? __eou__ Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . __eou__ Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . __eou__ Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five . __eou__ Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ...
Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old . __eou__ Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro . __eou__ Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint . __eou__ No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places . __eou__ This is one of my favorite items . __eou__ How did you get it ?
Why didn't you text me last night ? __eou__ What ? I sent you three or four messages ! __eou__ I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message . __eou__ Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . __eou__ Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . __eou__ I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? __eou__ I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . __eou__ No wonder you didn't get my texts !
I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat . __eou__ Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . __eou__ I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae . __eou__ You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol . __eou__ Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind . __eou__ It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on . __eou__ How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet , let's order some hot dogs ! __eou__ You are a lost cause .
OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? __eou__ Almost , let me just put my apron on . __eou__ OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . __eou__ Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? __eou__ Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . __eou__ OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? __eou__ Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . __eou__ Done . So how long do we bake it for ? __eou__ We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . __eou__ Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought !
What's for dinner ? __eou__ Leftovers . __eou__ What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? __eou__ From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! __eou__ Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? __eou__ Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . __eou__ Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat !
Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . __eou__ Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . __eou__ Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . __eou__ I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . __eou__ Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? __eou__ Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . __eou__ Oh yes , I ...
Look , Jimmy's report came today . __eou__ Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? __eou__ He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . __eou__ What about here in physical education ? __eou__ He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him . __eou__ So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F !
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me . __eou__ Is it a family thing or just friends ? __eou__ A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . __eou__ Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny . __eou__ Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife . __eou__ You mean your sister ? __eou__ No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother . __eou__ You lost me . __eou__ I'll explain later , let's go .
I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . __eou__ What ? Why ? __eou__ Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . __eou__ Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . __eou__ Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . __eou__ I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . __eou__ I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . __eou__ Good luck with that !
What's wrong ? __eou__ I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .
Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . __eou__ Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . __eou__ OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect ! I'll take it !
Whoa ! This is a massive flea market ! __eou__ You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here . __eou__ And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff . __eou__ This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it ! __eou__ You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan . __eou__ Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings !
You want to go get a facial with me today ? __eou__ Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . __eou__ Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . __eou__ True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? __eou__ Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . __eou__ That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . __eou__ Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . __eou__ Uh ... no .
OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ? __eou__ Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . __eou__ Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long . __eou__ What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ? __eou__ I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle . __eou__ Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ?
Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here . __eou__ Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA . __eou__ Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? __eou__ OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . __eou__ You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . __eou__ Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good !
How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun ! __eou__ They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem . __eou__ An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia . __eou__ It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive . __eou__ That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ? __eou__ No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too .
Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . __eou__ Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . __eou__ Show me some classic high heels , please . __eou__ Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? __eou__ Black . Classic . __eou__ Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . __eou__ Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . __eou__ OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . __eou__ I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for . __eou__ What size ? __eou__ Seven-and-a-half . __eou__ Here we are . How does it fit ? __eou__ Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time . __eou__ Have a nice day , Ma ’ am .
I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! __eou__ What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! __eou__ On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . __eou__ Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? __eou__ Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . __eou__ What type of tools ? __eou__ You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . __eou__ Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? __eou__ I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! __eou__ Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !
I'm planning on going to the market soon . __eou__ What are you buying ? __eou__ I don't know what we need . __eou__ I can check for you , if you'd like . __eou__ I'll make a list . __eou__ First , we need eggs , milk , and bread . __eou__ Okay , do we need any meat ? __eou__ How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? __eou__ What else do we need ? __eou__ Get some snack foods .
What can I help you with today ? __eou__ My washing machine isn't working . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ The water will not drain . __eou__ Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ No , that's it . __eou__ I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like . __eou__ When will you be able to fix it ? __eou__ How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you ? __eou__ That would be perfect . __eou__ Alright , so I'll see you then ? __eou__ See you then .
Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time !
Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . __eou__ Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . __eou__ How long does it take to get there ? __eou__ About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . __eou__ Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! __eou__ Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . __eou__ Great ! I ’ ll take it . __eou__ Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! __eou__ I understand . Thank you very much ! __eou__ Have a great trip .
Honey , can you set the table ? __eou__ Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? __eou__ Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . __eou__ Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? __eou__ Yeah , go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . __eou__ I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . __eou__ Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? __eou__ They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there .

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny .
Hey , what are you doing here ? __eou__ I'm just shopping . __eou__ What are you shopping for ? __eou__ Some new clothes .

Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . __eou__ Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . __eou__ Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__ Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob .
It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? __eou__ Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! __eou__ Dad ! Are you serious ?

I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . __eou__ Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__ When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !

Don ’ t breathe on me ! __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__ Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__ Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath .

Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? __eou__ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . __eou__ Me ! Me ! __eou__ Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__ Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__ Well , OK . But no French kissing ! __eou__ As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base !

I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . __eou__ There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help .

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . __eou__ There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ Yes , there is . Those organizations exist .

Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ? __eou__ Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan . __eou__ An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ? __eou__ You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen . __eou__ So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ? __eou__ You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system . __eou__ It sounds so complicated ! __eou__ No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops .

So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? __eou__ I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . __eou__ No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it .

I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
Welcome to the National Post . How may I help you ? __eou__ Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . __eou__ Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package . __eou__ How much is this going to cost ? __eou__ Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? __eou__ What ’ s the difference ? __eou__ Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days .

Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile .

It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly ! __eou__ he bought me an iron . __eou__ that doesn ’ t sound like a great present . __eou__ maybe not , but my iron was getting old .

Are you ok ? __eou__ yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u __eou__ yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt . __eou__ yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__ exactly .

I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__ cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__ yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just __eou__ is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets __eou__ but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__ of course , that's something really irritation . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb

I'm going to the hospital to see Susan Green . __eou__ I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . __eou__ Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? __eou__ No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . __eou__ Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? __eou__ Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and I had to wait for half an hour at the bus stop __eou__ Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . __eou__ But number 13 buses leave from the centre of town .

Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? __eou__ I like doughnuts .

Do you think children watch too much tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .

I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__ When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__ Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time __eou__ How do I do that ? __eou__ Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together .

I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .

Hello sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . __eou__ I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . __eou__ Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . __eou__ We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . __eou__ What about Wi-fi ? __eou__ Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . __eou__ One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! __eou__ Are you trying to lose weight ? __eou__ Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . __eou__ You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . __eou__ Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? __eou__ Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . __eou__ So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? __eou__ Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . __eou__ If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? __eou__ Don ’ t count on it .
It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? __eou__ Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! __eou__ Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! __eou__ Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . __eou__ Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! __eou__ When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !
So can you fix it ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . __eou__ What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! __eou__ Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! __eou__ OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? __eou__ Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . __eou__ I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! __eou__ This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back !
Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! __eou__ I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__ Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . __eou__ So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? __eou__ Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . __eou__ Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__ No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__ You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .

We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! __eou__ Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu __eou__ No problem , just get rid of the bugs !
Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . __eou__ Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . __eou__ Show me some classic high heels , please . __eou__ Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? __eou__ Black . Classic . __eou__ Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . __eou__ Umm . too shiny .

Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . __eou__ What size ? __eou__ Seven-and-a-half . __eou__ Here we are . How does it fit ? __eou__ Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo __eou__ Have a nice day , Ma ’ am .
I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! __eou__ What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! __eou__ On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . __eou__ Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? __eou__ Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . __eou__ What type of tools ? __eou__ You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . __eou__ Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? __eou__ I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! __eou__ Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !

This is really delicious ! __eou__ I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__ Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . __eou__ I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . __eou__ How do you mean " suffer " ? __eou__ I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . __eou__ Even in the winter ? __eou__ Yes , even in the winter . __eou__ And even if it takes two hours , huh ? __eou__ Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__ Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__ Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! __eou__ I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__ Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . __eou__ So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? __eou__ Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__ And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . __eou__ Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? __eou__ No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . __eou__ Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? __eou__ No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . __eou__ I wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__ I'm a great cook actually . You will see .
Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? __eou__ Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . __eou__ Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? __eou__ Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . __eou__ Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . __eou__ You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! __eou__ You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? __eou__ You ’ re so picky sometimes . __eou__ Here you go , honey , fried eggs . __eou__ I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .
I really appreciate your driving me around . __eou__ It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . __eou__ It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . __eou__ So what do you see in there ? __eou__ This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . __eou__ Can you afford that much ? __eou__ No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency . __eou__ Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person . __eou__ How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ? __eou__ That means the apartment has furniture in it . __eou__ That's good . __eou__ Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . __eou__ Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 . __eou__ It's still pretty expensive . __eou__ Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one . __eou__ Alright . What's the phone number ? __eou__ 256-7797 . __eou__ Got it . What else do you see ? __eou__ This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ? __eou__ No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom . __eou__ That sounds alright . __eou__ Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . __eou__ Here's the number , 256-4367 . __eou__ Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . __eou__ Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this . __eou__ Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ?
Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . __eou__ Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? __eou__ We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll take it . __eou__ Where would you like to sit ? __eou__ Do you have anything in the middle section ?

Hello . May I help you ? __eou__ Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ? __eou__ That one is one hundred and fifty dollars . __eou__ One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ? __eou__ That ’ s one hundred and forty . __eou__ Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ? __eou__ This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around . __eou__ Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ? __eou__ That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ? __eou__ Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both . __eou__ I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway . __eou__ my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer ! __eou__ Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal !
I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . __eou__ I would like to rent a car with a good stereo . __eou__ All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us . __eou__ Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time . __eou__ Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot . __eou__ This is a Porsche ! __eou__ Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . __eou__ Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . __eou__ But how can you do that ? __eou__ It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it almost looks new .
Can you finish your homework in ten minutes ? __eou__ It will be a piece of cake .

Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! __eou__ Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf .
May I have a look at that vase , please ? __eou__ Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . __eou__ Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__ It looks delicious . __eou__ Well here . Help yourself to some shrimp . It's fresh .
May I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother . He's going to take a trip to South America . __eou__ By air or by sea ? __eou__ By air . So my gift should be quite light . What can you suggest ? __eou__ How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather . __eou__ My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual . __eou__ This gift is the best for a man who has everything . __eou__ Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it .
I'm concerned about your car . __eou__ It will be fine . __eou__ But I think I can help to fix it . __eou__ No , don't give it another thought .
Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting . __eou__ No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway . __eou__ Oh , good . __eou__ How much will it cost ? __eou__ Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . __eou__ Taxi ! ! ! __eou__ I can ’ t find the business card . Do you know the address ? __eou__ Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ Driver , 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . , please .

Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ? __eou__ Take the A train south to the Liberty Ave . stop .

You have to finish your dinner before you leave the table . __eou__ But , Mom , I can't eat anymore . I'm stuffed . __eou__ What's the matter ? It doesn't taste good ? __eou__ It's not that I don't like your cooking , but I ate some cookies before we had dinner .
I'm looking forward to our son's graduation this weekend . __eou__ Yes . So am I . But what will he do after graduation ? He really needs to go to college . __eou__ Well , dear , we can't force him to go to college . It's up to him . __eou__ I know that but he has to learn to be independent . He can't just keep living at home .
I have been washing the dishes for over a week now . __eou__ Well , I think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week . __eou__ No . We made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes . Now it's your turn to do them . __eou__ OK , I'll do them .

Look out ! A small boy is rushing out blindly . __eou__ Gee , how dangerous ! I've almost knocked him down . __eou__ You stopped just in time . Good for you ! __eou__ I braked as hard as I could .
Read Jimmy's card to me please , Janey . __eou__ I have just arrived in Scotland and I'm staying at a Youth Hostel . __eou__ Eh ? __eou__ He says he's just arrived in Scotland . He says he's staying at a Youth Hostel . You know he's a member of the Y . H . A . __eou__ The what ? __eou__ The Y . H . A . , mun . The Youth Hostel's Association . __eou__ What else does he say ? __eou__ I'll write a letter soon . I hope you are all well . __eou__ What ? Speak up , Janey . I'm afraid I can't hear you . __eou__ He says he'll write a letter soon . He hopes we are all well . Love , Jimmy . __eou__ Is that all ? He doesn't say very much , does he ? __eou__ He can't write very much on a card , mum .
Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? __eou__ Yes . Thank you . __eou__ Would you care for a drink before you order ? __eou__ A glass of Qingdao beer . __eou__ Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? __eou__ Will you make some recommendation ?
What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__ Come on ! A little labor , much health . __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ Believe I will . Look for me near the lake .
Could I have my bill , please ? __eou__ Certainly , sir . __eou__ I'm afraid there has been a mistake . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ? __eou__ I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here . __eou__ I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
I finally found an apartment that I want to rent . __eou__ Where did you see it ? __eou__ I saw it in this ad for apartments in today ’ s newspaper . __eou__ You found an apartment in the ads ? __eou__ I really did , but what ’ s so great about it is that it ’ s really affordable . __eou__ Tell me about the apartment . __eou__ Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful . __eou__ How much is the rent for the apartment ? __eou__ The rent is $ 725 each month . __eou__ That ’ s pretty cheap for out here . __eou__ That ’ s what I said when I found out how much the rent was . __eou__ Congratulations on the new apartment .
Excuse me ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Is this your handbag ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Thank you very much .
What do you think this flat ? __eou__ It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us . __eou__ Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . __eou__ But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . __eou__ That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine . __eou__ True , and I like the kitchen.It ' s new and well equipped . __eou__ It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . __eou__ You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__ May be we could get some new furniture , better stuff . __eou__ I haven't thought of that .
This apartment is wonderful . __eou__ I ’ m glad you like it . __eou__ How much would I have to pay for rent ? __eou__ The rent is $ 1050 each month . __eou__ That ’ s way too much money . __eou__ It isn ’ t too much . __eou__ How about if I pay $ 850 ? __eou__ I can ’ t take that . __eou__ I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 . __eou__ I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you . __eou__ You can ’ t go any lower than that ? __eou__ If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal .
May I speak to the apartment building manager , please ? __eou__ I'm the manager . How can I help you ? __eou__ I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available . __eou__ Why , yes , it is . Would you like to get a look inside the apartment ? __eou__ Yes , it would be nice to see the apartment . __eou__ How about today at 6 o'clock ? __eou__ Yes , I can be there at 6 . __eou__ Sounds good . I'll see you at 6 . Do you want directions ? __eou__ I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest . __eou__ If you like the place , you can fill out an application form . I'll bring one with me . __eou__ Is there anything that I need to bring with me ? __eou__ No . I won't need to see anything except your driver's license .
Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house ! __eou__ It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside . __eou__ It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place . __eou__ You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . __eou__ There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy . __eou__ Let ’ s go check out the kitchen . The printout says that it is quite large . __eou__ Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . __eou__ Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please . __eou__ What ’ s that smell ? __eou__ Perhaps we should move on to the next listing .
How ’ s it going ? __eou__ I ’ m fine , thank you . __eou__ Did you need help with something ? __eou__ If I could , I would like to view the apartment sometime today . __eou__ That won ’ t be possible today . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ You can only view the apartment with an appointment . __eou__ I would like to make one right now if I can . __eou__ Are you available this Friday ? __eou__ Can we do it at 6 o ’ clock ? __eou__ Your appointment for Friday at 6 pm has been confirmed . __eou__ All right . I ’ ll see you on Friday .
Could I speak to the apartment manager ? __eou__ I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ? __eou__ I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent . __eou__ I haven't rented it out yet . Would you like to see it ? __eou__ Yes , I want to see it . __eou__ How about today at 6 p . m . ? __eou__ That time is okay with me . __eou__ Very good . We'll meet at 6 . Do you need directions ? __eou__ No , thank you . I go by there on my way to work . __eou__ If you're interested , you can fill out an application form . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ? __eou__ No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license .
What do you think about the apartment so far ? __eou__ It is beautiful . __eou__ You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ? __eou__ Actually , there is a problem . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ There are some stains that were left in the carpet . __eou__ Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in . __eou__ Oh , is that right ? __eou__ Yes . Now what other problems do you have ? __eou__ That was the only problem that I saw . __eou__ Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking . __eou__ I honestly love it .
How are you doing ? __eou__ Everything ’ s fine with me . __eou__ What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ? __eou__ Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . __eou__ Why can ’ t I view it today ? __eou__ You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . __eou__ I understand . May I make an appointment then ? __eou__ How does this Friday sound ? __eou__ Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect . __eou__ That will be fine . __eou__ Thanks for your help .
I would love to rent out your apartment . __eou__ That ’ s great . __eou__ How much is the rent ? __eou__ The rent each month is $ 1050 . __eou__ That ’ s a lot of money . __eou__ Did you have a better price in mind ? __eou__ What about $ 800 ? __eou__ That ’ s way too low . __eou__ I can ’ t pay much more than that . __eou__ How about $ 900 a month ? __eou__ That would be fine . __eou__ Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you .
What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ? __eou__ The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time . __eou__ What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ? __eou__ You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__ There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . __eou__ Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . __eou__ I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . __eou__ That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . __eou__ I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ? __eou__ I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is !
Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ? __eou__ Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ? __eou__ I never had a home inspection before . __eou__ I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through . __eou__ I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house . __eou__ The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future . __eou__ I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . __eou__ I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems . __eou__ What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ? __eou__ I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist .
What would be a good day to finally move into the house ? __eou__ You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you . __eou__ Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ? __eou__ Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in . __eou__ The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color . __eou__ An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in . __eou__ I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house . __eou__ I think that will work out just fine . It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold . __eou__ Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in ? __eou__ My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day .
I came in to see how my home inspection went . __eou__ First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ? __eou__ I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . __eou__ I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it . __eou__ The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month . __eou__ Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken . __eou__ Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ? __eou__ The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced . __eou__ Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ? __eou__ The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe .
When can I move into my new house ? __eou__ The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday . __eou__ Will the utilities be turned on ? __eou__ You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__ I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned . __eou__ If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . __eou__ I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . __eou__ That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . __eou__ Can you help me on my move-in day ? __eou__ I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is .
so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . __eou__ That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . __eou__ yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . __eou__ Did you buy new cupboards too ? __eou__ no , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . __eou__ I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . __eou__ yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .
I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please . __eou__ This is he . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street . __eou__ It's still available . Do you want to see it ? __eou__ Yes , I would very much like to see it . __eou__ Does today at 6 p . m . sound okay to you ? __eou__ I have no problem with 6 p . m . __eou__ Okay , I'll see you at 6 o'clock . Do you need any directions ? __eou__ No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like . __eou__ I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested . __eou__ Should I bring anything with me ? __eou__ No . I only need to check your driver's license .
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . __eou__ ok , what do you want me to do ? __eou__ first of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . __eou__ ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ?

I make it according to my own secret recipe .

I need to talk to you about something . __eou__ What did you need to talk about ? __eou__ I have some questions about my lease . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Exactly how long is my lease for ? __eou__ Your lease will be up in three years . __eou__ What will happen if I move out before then ? __eou__ If you move out before then , you will not get your deductible . __eou__ I don ’ t understand . __eou__ Because our contract says that you will live here for three years . __eou__ Okay , I think that I understand . __eou__ I ’ m glad you understand .

you're finally here ! What took so long ? __eou__ I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . __eou__ it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . __eou__ I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . __eou__ perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . __eou__ I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ it would be better for the environment , too . __eou__ I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__ taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__ the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . __eou__ well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__ that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__ so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__ yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
is that your rabbit ? __eou__ yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . __eou__ that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . __eou__ well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . __eou__ rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? __eou__ if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . __eou__ i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? __eou__ not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its __eou__ that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? __eou__ No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__ can you train a rabbit to do things ? __eou__ you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__ that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? __eou__ not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people .
I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap . __eou__ I know and they are really nice , too . __eou__ I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__ Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . __eou__ Good idea , especially at this price .
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . __eou__ Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . __eou__ What does it come with standard ? __eou__ On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com __eou__ Cruise control ? I don't like that . __eou__ Why not , sir ? __eou__ I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? __eou__ Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . __eou__ I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . __eou__ You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . __eou__ I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? __eou__ No , the sunroof is optional , sir . __eou__ I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . __eou__ Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . __eou__ That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? __eou__ We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . __eou__ My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . __eou__ I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? __eou__ Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . __eou__ Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car . __eou__ You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__ Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else.The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . __eou__ Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .
Why don't we get you some shirts ? __eou__ I want to leave . We've already been here two hours . __eou__ But we should get you some shirts while we're here . You need summer shirts . __eou__ I would rather buy them somewhere else . __eou__ Why ? They have everything here . __eou__ I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety . __eou__ Let's just look and see what they have . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? __eou__ The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping . __eou__ Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . __eou__ Sure I would . __eou__ Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on . __eou__ Do they have it in LARGE . __eou__ I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on . __eou__ Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it . __eou__ The fitting rooms are over there . __eou__ Okay , I will try it on . __eou__ It looks good on you . __eou__ I look like a nerd . __eou__ No , it looks great.Why are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good . __eou__ Well , I don't think it's the best style for me . __eou__ I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too . __eou__ Alright . Alright . __eou__ You should be happy I want you to look good.If I let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything . __eou__ Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls .
I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . __eou__ It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . __eou__ What instructions ? __eou__ We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . __eou__ I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . __eou__ Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! __eou__ Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? __eou__ Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . __eou__ Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? __eou__ The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . __eou__ Sawdust ? __eou__ Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . __eou__ That makes sense . __eou__ Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . __eou__ And I can choose any color ? __eou__ Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . __eou__ And after the varnish ? __eou__ After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . __eou__ It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . __eou__ Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it . __eou__ Alright , sir .
How can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . __eou__ Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now.But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . __eou__ Well , you made a good choice . Coming to us , I mean.We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__ What do you have in foundation ? __eou__ Our foundation is very high quality . Only the finest ingredients.It will moisturize your skin and it has a sun block rating of 8 . __eou__ What colors do you have in foundation ? __eou__ Let me show you.We have this rose color . We also have different shades of beige . __eou__ The color I use now is rose.How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . __eou__ In this size , we sell it for 53.95 . __eou__ Wow ! That's expensive . __eou__ What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients.It is a very high quality product . __eou__ I understand . I need some mascara too.Do you have a good thickening mascara ? __eou__ Of course . Here is our thickening mascara.We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . __eou__ Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ? __eou__ We have a very wide selection of colors.And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin.So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? __eou__ Oh , sure . I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . __eou__ I can help you with that . __eou__ Thank you .
What should I get Uncle Teddy ? __eou__ You could get him a tie . __eou__ Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . __eou__ Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . __eou__ That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . __eou__ He would think you were crazy , Caroline . __eou__ Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . __eou__ How much do you want to spend ? __eou__ Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . __eou__ Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . __eou__ What should he have then ? __eou__ I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . __eou__ I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? __eou__ I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . __eou__ Alright . We can go later then . __eou__ We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . __eou__ Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? __eou__ She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . __eou__ Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? __eou__ How about the iguana ? __eou__ I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . __eou__ A tie ? __eou__ Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? __eou__ I was just kidding .
May I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I want to buy a VCR . __eou__ Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ? __eou__ No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son . __eou__ I see . And does your son have a VCR now ? __eou__ Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR . __eou__ Does he watch a lot of movies ? __eou__ Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university . __eou__ I would like to make a suggestion then , sir . __eou__ Please do . __eou__ If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself . __eou__ Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use . __eou__ May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? __eou__ DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? __eou__ It is very similar . The technology is the same . __eou__ Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? __eou__ For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . __eou__ But isn't it more expensive ? __eou__ It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . __eou__ And why not ? __eou__ Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . __eou__ Hmm . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes , it is , sir . __eou__ Well . And what about DVDs ? __eou__ This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot . __eou__ Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film . __eou__ So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future . __eou__ Alright , please show me what you have .

Do you have any shoes like these ? __eou__ What size ? __eou__ Size five . __eou__ What colour ? __eou__ Black . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any . __eou__ But my sister bought this pair last month . __eou__ Did she buy them here ? __eou__ No , she bought them in the U . S . __eou__ We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now . __eou__ Can you get a pair for me please ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now . __eou__ They look very uncomfortable . __eou__ They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !
What's Ron Marston like , Pauline ? __eou__ He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . __eou__ What did your boss say to him ? __eou__ He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! __eou__ Did he telephone again last night ? __eou__ Yes , he did . He telephoned at nine o'clock . __eou__ What did you say to him ? __eou__ I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! __eou__ Did he telephone again ? __eou__ No , he didn't !
Good afternoon . I believe that this house is for sale . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ May I have a look at it please ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Come in . __eou__ How long have you lived here ? __eou__ I have lived here for twenty years . __eou__ Twenty years ! That's a long time . __eou__ Yes , I have been here since 1976 . __eou__ Then why do you want to sell it ? __eou__ Because I have just retired . I want to buy a small house in the country . __eou__ How much does this house cost ? __eou__ 6850 pound . __eou__ That's a lot of money ! __eou__ It's worth every penny of it . __eou__ Well , I like the house , but I can't decide yet . My wife must see it first . __eou__ Women always have the last word .
I need a haircut . __eou__ Do you have an appointment ? __eou__ No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ? __eou__ Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning . __eou__ Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ? __eou__ Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style . __eou__ I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now . __eou__ Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . __eou__ So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ And do you usually part your hair along here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends . __eou__ Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair . __eou__ The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy . __eou__ I don't know what to do about it . __eou__ Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g __eou__ Do you sell conditioner here ? __eou__ Of course . I have one I can suggest . __eou__ Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . __eou__ The problem is the split ends .
Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ? __eou__ Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ? __eou__ Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off __eou__ Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey __eou__ Can I write that down ? __eou__ Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? __eou__ Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year . __eou__ Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart . __eou__ What are those stores ? __eou__ They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . __eou__ Even silverware ? __eou__ Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . __eou__ I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ? __eou__ I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store . __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics . __eou__ Electronics ? __eou__ Yes . Like stereos and televisions . __eou__ How much is the membership fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all __eou__ I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things . __eou__ I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome .
do you like cooking , Julia ? __eou__ I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! __eou__ how often do you usually cook ? __eou__ I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . __eou__ that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . __eou__ I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . __eou__ what kind of dishes do you usually make ? __eou__ I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . __eou__ do you make a lot of traditional British food ? __eou__ aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . __eou__ how about spicy food ? __eou__ my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . __eou__ what's your favorite dish to make ? __eou__ I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it .
I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture . __eou__ the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ? __eou__ I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me . __eou__ well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? __eou__ most some drinks have too much sugar in them . __eou__ the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? __eou__ I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? __eou__ unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? __eou__ I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? __eou__ maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . __eou__ maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? __eou__ you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . __eou__ that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . __eou__ thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet .
do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? __eou__ no , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ? __eou__ I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? __eou__ I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! __eou__ I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! __eou__ I know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . __eou__ I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? __eou__ yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? __eou__ I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! __eou__ what do we do first ? __eou__ first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . __eou__ ok . Should I heat the wok ? __eou__ yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . __eou__ what about the chicken ? __eou__ that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . __eou__ how about the rice ? __eou__ I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? __eou__ white rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me !
are you ready for your first driving lesson ? __eou__ yes . Which one is the brake again ? __eou__ the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . __eou__ I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . __eou__ automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . __eou__ you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! __eou__ very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? __eou__ I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? __eou__ how ’ s that ? __eou__ that ’ s better . Now what ? __eou__ check your petrol situation . __eou__ the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . __eou__ I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . __eou__ remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! __eou__ why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
how can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend . __eou__ do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? __eou__ she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . __eou__ ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes . __eou__ which one would you recommend ? __eou__ personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? __eou__ that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . __eou__ would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__ it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy . __eou__ how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick . __eou__ she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . __eou__ how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . __eou__ no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . __eou__ I know what she would like---some whitening cream . __eou__ no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . __eou__ will that be all then ? __eou__ that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks .
can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . __eou__ sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? __eou__ it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . __eou__ that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? __eou__ I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . __eou__ brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? __eou__ haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . __eou__ why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! __eou__ that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . __eou__ here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? __eou__ I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . __eou__ how about this one ? __eou__ I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . __eou__ ok , let's go .
it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! __eou__ we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__ that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? __eou__ sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . __eou__ that would be lovely , thanks . __eou__ do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . __eou__ ok . What do you think about our living room ? __eou__ well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient . __eou__ my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . __eou__ oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . __eou__ your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming . __eou__ I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help . __eou__ that ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
how is your house hunting going ? __eou__ not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ how much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! __eou__ how long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . __eou__ do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ no , I thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ I don't think I can afford that . __eou__ don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children . __eou__ that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .
How much is this ? __eou__ You mean the large one or the small one ? __eou__ The large one . __eou__ They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars . __eou__ Is this the only kind you have ? __eou__ No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide . __eou__ Very well . Just take your time .
ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? __eou__ I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . __eou__ what ? I don't understand . __eou__ I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ? __eou__ Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' ! __eou__ Huh ? What were you talking about , then ? __eou__ ' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly ! __eou__ oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway !
How can I get to Lakeside Park ? __eou__ Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . __eou__ Will it take me straight there ? __eou__ Yes . No need to change .
Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? __eou__ Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . __eou__ Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? __eou__ No , it's just a couple of minutes . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__ You're welcome .
it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ what kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ ok , let ’ s go then ! __eou__ do you have any money ? __eou__ for what ? __eou__ for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ you said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ I should have known ...
Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . __eou__ oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? __eou__ it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . __eou__ I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . __eou__ oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . __eou__ I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . __eou__ But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . __eou__ well , that's true . __eou__ how about your mother ? __eou__ she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals . __eou__ poor you . It seems we are in the same boat . __eou__ Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . __eou__ really ? so you don't have fried food at all . __eou__ not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . __eou__ how do you manage it ? __eou__ it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat .
I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? __eou__ sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? __eou__ how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . __eou__ dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! __eou__ well , what do you have in mind ? __eou__ how about the Mongolian hot pot ? __eou__ oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! __eou__ maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . __eou__ sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . __eou__ yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . __eou__ great . Let's go ! __eou__ wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater .
wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? __eou__ the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . __eou__ I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . __eou__ absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day . __eou__ incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? __eou__ oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one . __eou__ thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . __eou__ Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . __eou__ oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? __eou__ certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique __eou__ it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . __eou__ Yes , Amy , please have some more .
I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . __eou__ As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ? __eou__ I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . __eou__ We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . __eou__ That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me . __eou__ The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . __eou__ When will we know if they accept the offer ? __eou__ The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . __eou__ Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? __eou__ You are already pre-qualified for your loan , so you are in good shape .

Do you have any idea what time it is ? __eou__ My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late . __eou__ Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ? __eou__ Of course not . I really did lose track of time . __eou__ Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late ? __eou__ Yeah , you did . I just forgot to call . __eou__ It doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know . __eou__ That's true . My bad for not calling . __eou__ If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . __eou__ You're going to kick me out over this ? __eou__ Exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules . __eou__ Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules .

Thank you . __eou__ Your total comes to $ 5.48 . __eou__ Here you go . Thank you very much .
Do you know how late it is ? __eou__ My fault . I didn't realize what time it was . __eou__ I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook . __eou__ Not really . I'm telling the truth . __eou__ Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? __eou__ This is true , but it must've slipped my mind . __eou__ Regardless , all you had to do was give a call . __eou__ I know . I should've called . __eou__ Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . __eou__ You want to throw me out over this ? __eou__ That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules . __eou__ That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter .

I have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house . __eou__ Leave the details of making the offer up to me .

How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? __eou__ I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer . __eou__ Your offering price is not out-of-line . The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer . __eou__ Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ? __eou__ It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer . __eou__ Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ? __eou__ The only thing you should do now is relax . You already are pre-qualified for your loan .

Hopefully I won't have to call about him again .
Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet ? __eou__ The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . __eou__ Should I accept their offer ? __eou__ There are two ways to respond . You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . __eou__ What if I make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? __eou__ No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . __eou__ I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . __eou__ OK , I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . __eou__ How long before I find out what their decision is ? __eou__ By now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept . It will go quickly .
I believe that you called me ? __eou__ Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly . __eou__ Why did you call me ? __eou__ I was calling about your son . __eou__ Did he do something wrong ? __eou__ Your son was acting up in class . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ He was talking and causing a disturbance during class . __eou__ That's really not like him . __eou__ If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it . __eou__ I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again . __eou__ Don't worry about it , but thank you very much .
Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ? __eou__ In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . __eou__ That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do . __eou__ You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer . __eou__ If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ? __eou__ Personally , I would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do . __eou__ Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer . __eou__ I will contact the sellers with your current offer . __eou__ Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ? __eou__ Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one .
Why'd you run into me ? __eou__ I didn't mean to . It was an accident . __eou__ You have completely damaged my car . __eou__ I did not . It looks perfectly fine . __eou__ You don't see what happened to my bumper ? __eou__ What did I do to it ? __eou__ You smashed my bumper in with your car . __eou__ I really don't think that I did that . __eou__ Your bumper looks exactly the same . __eou__ Look , just give me your insurance and number and I'll take care of it . __eou__ Give me your information , in case I don't hear from you . __eou__ Trust me .
I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . __eou__ I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . __eou__ Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ? __eou__ They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer . __eou__ Is a home inspection very expensive ? __eou__ It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars . __eou__ Do I get to choose who inspects the home ? __eou__ Yes , you get to choose . I would spend a little more to get a really thorough inspection . __eou__ Can you call the owners with my acceptance right away ? __eou__ I am going to contact the sellers immediately .

Let ’ s see what the interior looks like . __eou__ I am not impressed by the interior of this house . __eou__ Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint . __eou__ With so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ? __eou__ I think that we should check out the kitchen . It is listed as roomy and spacious . __eou__ Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ? __eou__ The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . I think that we should go look at it since we are here . __eou__ Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ? __eou__ Well , I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you .
Were you able to contact the owners about my counter-offer ? __eou__ Yes , please have a seat , and we ’ ll discuss this right now . __eou__ I hope that they accepted the counter-offer . __eou__ The counter-offer was acceptable to them , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . __eou__ Will the home inspection cost me a lot ? __eou__ It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars . __eou__ Is it my choice as to who inspects this house ? __eou__ Yes , it is your choice as you are paying for it .

What a great front entryway ! __eou__ We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here . __eou__ That works for me . We can check out the kitchen next . __eou__ On such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers . __eou__ Check out the flyer with all of the home ’ s information on it . __eou__ What is the price of this house in the flyer ? __eou__ They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market . It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand .

This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . __eou__ You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! __eou__ You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . __eou__ Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ? __eou__ You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments . __eou__ I am going to take care of the rent payment right now . __eou__ Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check .
I received an eviction notice from you , and I don ’ t understand what it means . __eou__ Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ’ s a 30 - day notice to vacate . __eou__ You can ’ t make me move just for being late with my rent . __eou__ You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself . __eou__ Are you throwing me out ? __eou__ This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don ’ t make good on your rent . __eou__ If I catch up on my rent , can I stay ? __eou__ You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . Otherwise , I will find another renter . __eou__ I will go get the money right now . __eou__ Thank you . Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier ’ s check .
I have to move . __eou__ You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . __eou__ I can ’ t stay here anymore . __eou__ There ’ s a problem with that . __eou__ What is the problem ? __eou__ I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ This was stated in our agreement . __eou__ But I need it back . __eou__ I can ’ t do that . __eou__ It will be impossible for me to stay here . __eou__ That ’ s not my fault .
I need to see if I qualify for a home loan . __eou__ I can help you . How much money do you make per year ? __eou__ I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year . __eou__ How long have you been on your current job ? __eou__ I have only worked at this job for 6 months , but I have a longer job history elsewhere . __eou__ Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust ? __eou__ No , I only receive my salary . __eou__ Do you know your credit score ? __eou__ I think that it is around 600 . __eou__ By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars .
I have a good feeling about this house . __eou__ Yes , I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it . __eou__ I love the paint job ! __eou__ If you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside . __eou__ What a beautiful home ! __eou__ You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new . __eou__ I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street . __eou__ Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it . __eou__ I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen . __eou__ The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom . __eou__ I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering ! __eou__ Let ’ s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home .
I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you . __eou__ Would mornings or afternoons be best for you ? __eou__ It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon . __eou__ It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you ? __eou__ Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend . __eou__ Would you like to meet at the real estate office , or should I pick you up at home ? __eou__ If you could pick me up at home , that would be great . __eou__ We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see . __eou__ That might be a little too much , but we ’ ll see how it goes . __eou__ I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times .
I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy . __eou__ We can figure that out right now . How much do you earn annually ? __eou__ My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year . __eou__ How many years have you held your current position ? __eou__ I have been at my current job for 10 years . __eou__ Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary ? __eou__ I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property . __eou__ Have you ever figured out your credit score ? __eou__ I try not to think about it ! __eou__ Adding in your expenses , I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house .
I want to go house shopping , and I want to know what I can afford to buy . __eou__ There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ? __eou__ I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . __eou__ What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ? __eou__ I have been at the job I now have for 2 years , and I have been with the company for 6 years total . __eou__ Do you receive any other income ? __eou__ I own a small rental unit with a partner , and I receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit . __eou__ Do you know what your credit score is ? __eou__ I don ’ t know , but the last time I checked , it was very good ! __eou__ You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more !
Hello , I would like to make an appointment to look at houses . __eou__ Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ? __eou__ I would prefer mornings . __eou__ Can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ? __eou__ Going to look at houses during the week is best for me . __eou__ Where would you like me to pick you up ? __eou__ I will meet you at the real estate office . __eou__ I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take about two hours . __eou__ That sounds good to me . __eou__ Once I contact the owners and confirm the times , I will e-mail you a schedule .
I really like the way this house looks . __eou__ Yes , it has great curb appeal . __eou__ The landscaping is wonderful ! __eou__ Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior . __eou__ Oh , I see what you mean ! __eou__ The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments . __eou__ I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls . __eou__ Come and see the kitchen . __eou__ Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink ! __eou__ Let ’ s go check out the bedroom and bathroom . __eou__ I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom . __eou__ I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it .

But you are such a genius . __eou__ Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ Let's go !

What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . __eou__ I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . __eou__ I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . __eou__ I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . __eou__ Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time .
We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? __eou__ Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . __eou__ While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . __eou__ You sure have a lot of discs here . __eou__ Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music .

Hello ? __eou__ Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__ Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__ She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__ Is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__ She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__ Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__ Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__ I'd prefer to speak with Ms .

I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn't necessarily better than the other .

How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing . __eou__ How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate all your help . __eou__ You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .
We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? __eou__ But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? __eou__ After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . __eou__ How often do you meet ? __eou__ We plan to get together once a week . __eou__ What days , do you know ? __eou__ We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . __eou__ Okay , count me in .
What kind of note are you taking there . That looks like doodle to me . __eou__ It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today . __eou__ Does that actually work for you ? __eou__ I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . __eou__ I like to use shorthand note taking . __eou__ I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . __eou__ Hmm . I never thought about it that way . __eou__ One time I tried just listening , no notes , no pictures . I think I really learned more that day .
I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them ! __eou__ Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday ! __eou__ I hate this part of school . __eou__ Why did you put it off until the last minute ? __eou__ I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time . __eou__ Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester . __eou__ I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much . __eou__ I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself .
Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president . __eou__ Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? __eou__ We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . __eou__ And you think I fit the qualifications ? __eou__ Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . __eou__ Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? __eou__ Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . __eou__ I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first .
David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ? __eou__ After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . __eou__ Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side .
We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . __eou__ I guess we should start with nominees first . __eou__ Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . __eou__ We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . __eou__ Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that this afternoon . __eou__ Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? __eou__ Yes , let me put it on the calendar .
I really like my debate class . __eou__ Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? __eou__ I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . __eou__ You want to be a politician ? Yuck . __eou__ That's not like you to generalize . __eou__ Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . __eou__ I think I can do a lot of good for our country . __eou__ You're right . We need more people like you in politics .
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . __eou__ We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there . __eou__ Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? __eou__ Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . __eou__ Oh , no . It's already February 5th . __eou__ So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year . __eou__ I will think about it .
There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . __eou__ Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? __eou__ Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . __eou__ I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache .
I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But some classmates said you took the money . __eou__ It is not true . __eou__ Look at my eyes . __eou__ Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . __eou__ Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . __eou__ I will .
Good morning , Miss . __eou__ Morning . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . __eou__ All you need is your student identification card to check out books .
I've been looking forward to the new semester . __eou__ I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__ I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester . __eou__ Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . __eou__ I am sure we will .
By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You can check out two books at a time . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer .
Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? __eou__ My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__ Did you finish typing it yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? __eou__ Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . __eou__ How about the shelf ? __eou__ I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? __eou__ Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . __eou__ I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__ Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__ You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__ My poor memory . Thank you very much .
I got a ninety-five on my test . __eou__ So what ? I got a ninety-nine .
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time .
I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . __eou__ That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week .
Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . __eou__ I guess you'll have to wing it .
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? __eou__ Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . __eou__ So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . __eou__ No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . __eou__ What if I don't know the title of the book ? __eou__ Well , you can look under the author's name . __eou__ Could you give me an example ? __eou__ Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in .
I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members . __eou__ Really ? Can I join it ? __eou__ Of course you can if you like it . __eou__ How can I join it ? __eou__ There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . __eou__ OK , thank you .
Is that Mr . Green ? __eou__ This is him speaking . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . __eou__ Yes . I am very glad to have the chance .
Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ? __eou__ Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? __eou__ Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? __eou__ A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . __eou__ How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ? __eou__ Normally it can be completed in four years .
Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ He had moved and held a party on July 1st . __eou__ It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time . __eou__ Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . __eou__ You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him .
Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? __eou__ Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . __eou__ Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? __eou__ In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . __eou__ I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . __eou__ I bet nobody will care about it .
I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . __eou__ Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting .
Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! __eou__ Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . __eou__ You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . __eou__ Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . __eou__ It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__ You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . __eou__ I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . __eou__ If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it .
Is this the A housing office ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ? __eou__ I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full . __eou__ It is , but I can put you on a waiting list , if you would like . __eou__ Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ? __eou__ Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As . __eou__ Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ? __eou__ The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have .
It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ Which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? __eou__ Were I in your position , I'd go to America . __eou__ Which university should I apply to ? __eou__ There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you very much .
Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? __eou__ More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . __eou__ Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? __eou__ I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . __eou__ The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . __eou__ I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing . __eou__ Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? __eou__ My dad was , but not my mom .
How many credits are you taking this semester ? __eou__ I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . __eou__ What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? __eou__ Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . __eou__ If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? __eou__ I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . __eou__ Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work .
What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? __eou__ Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . __eou__ You are going to take courses ? __eou__ Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . __eou__ Sounds hard . __eou__ Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . __eou__ Won't you get lonely ? __eou__ Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something .
What do you think of your teacher ? __eou__ He's very strict with us . __eou__ And I hear he gives very good lectures . __eou__ Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared .
Could you tell me how to use the library ? __eou__ Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . __eou__ How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ? __eou__ Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . __eou__ I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ? __eou__ Yes , just over there to your right . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? __eou__ I register this Friday . __eou__ What classes do you plan on taking ? __eou__ I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . __eou__ Is that class really that popular ? __eou__ Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . __eou__ What other classes are you going to take ? __eou__ I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . __eou__ I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . __eou__ Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__ I had Professor Mahoney . __eou__ Is he an easy grader ? __eou__ I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? __eou__ Not at all . I got a 3.8 . __eou__ Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? __eou__ I got a 4.0 in that class . __eou__ Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . __eou__ It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . __eou__ Oh . That helps . Thanks .
Did you get your grades yet ? __eou__ Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__ Ouch . You must be very disappointed . __eou__ Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . __eou__ Why don't you re-take the class next year ? __eou__ That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? __eou__ I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . __eou__ My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . __eou__ What was your GPA before this semester ? __eou__ I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . __eou__ Why did it go down so much ? __eou__ Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . __eou__ What happened to you ? __eou__ I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . __eou__ You better stop slacking off . __eou__ You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore .
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? __eou__ You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ Did you register yet ? __eou__ Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ What classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . __eou__ That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ He does that ? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__ No problem , man .
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? __eou__ These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . __eou__ Can I check this one out ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . __eou__ Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . __eou__ All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . __eou__ Thanks for your help .

After three days , I will come to you for it . __eou__ No problem .
You'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately .
Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? __eou__ It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . __eou__ Why ? What's stressing you out ? __eou__ School .

You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes . __eou__ All right . But how ? __eou__ Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . __eou__ I see . But could you give me another piece of paper ? __eou__ OK . Here you are . Anybody who wants help , please come to me . __eou__ Thank you so much , Mr Addison .

Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ? __eou__ Well done !
Good morning . Mrs.Smith . __eou__ Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . __eou__ Well , what kind of books does she like ? __eou__ She's very fond of detective stories ? __eou__ I see . Has she read any detective stories ? __eou__ Oh , yes ! __eou__ Do you know if she's read this one ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has !

May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . __eou__ I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . __eou__ I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . __eou__ Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . __eou__ Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . __eou__ Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . __eou__ But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? __eou__ What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . __eou__ Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . __eou__ Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . __eou__ Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . __eou__ I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . __eou__ You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . __eou__ I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . __eou__ You can count on me .
I noticed your absence in class this morning . __eou__ I'm sorry , I overslept .
It's the 17th week now , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous . __eou__ Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? __eou__ No , I haven't began my preparations . __eou__ Then shall we make preparations together ? __eou__ Great . You can help me a lot with English . __eou__ All right . But I am very poor at math . Would you like to help me with my math ? __eou__ No problem .
Good morning , Miss . __eou__ Morning . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . __eou__ All you need is your student identification card to check out books . __eou__ Yes . Here's my identification . __eou__ That's all you need . __eou__ Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer . __eou__ I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? __eou__ Yes , over there to your left .
Excuse me , Miss . __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . __eou__ I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ? __eou__ Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon . __eou__ Good . See you later . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye .
How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing . __eou__ How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__ You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .

You should know how to use them . __eou__ Should we remember all the new words and expressions ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems . __eou__ Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching . __eou__ When shall we have a coaching period ? __eou__ How about tomorrow ? __eou__ Ok .

Tell me about it . __eou__ Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills . __eou__ I really admire you for that . How is it going ? __eou__ It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know .
What are you going to do for your year abroad , Tim ? __eou__ Study study study ! I want to learn a lot . __eou__ You ’ re going to take courses ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m going to take some university courses there . __eou__ Sounds hard . __eou__ Yes , but I think it ’ s probably for the best . __eou__ Won ’ t you get lonely ? __eou__ Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something .
I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . __eou__ Yeah , sometimes .
Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't . I am busy . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . __eou__ What kind of volunteer work ? __eou__ I help out at the children's hospital .

What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation ! __eou__ I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare . __eou__ Do you think it will help ? __eou__ It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record . __eou__ Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too . __eou__ I ’ ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow .
Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ? __eou__ Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things . __eou__ Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . __eou__ I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . __eou__ Yes , that happens . __eou__ I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall . __eou__ Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? __eou__ No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . __eou__ Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . __eou__ No , I thought I would take it later . __eou__ Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . __eou__ Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . __eou__ Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 __eou__ I can take it then . I have that time slot free . __eou__ Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . __eou__ I'll take it then . __eou__ Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? __eou__ I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . __eou__ Really ? That's great to know . __eou__ That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible .
Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? __eou__ Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? __eou__ Alright . Do you have a coin ? __eou__ Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . __eou__ Heads . __eou__ Sorry , it's tails . You lose . __eou__ Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . __eou__ Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? __eou__ No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . __eou__ Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . __eou__ Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? __eou__ Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I agree . __eou__ So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . __eou__ Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . __eou__ Are all lucky people so stuck up ? __eou__ C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . __eou__ Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . __eou__ Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ? __eou__ I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . __eou__ Alright . See you later .
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? __eou__ These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . __eou__ Can I check this one out ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . __eou__ Ok .

Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? __eou__ Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . __eou__ Are you Chinese ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I like it so far . But my English still needs work . __eou__ I want to study Mandarin and international relations . __eou__ Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? __eou__ They teach regular characters . __eou__ I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . __eou__ You just said your English needs work , yes ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . __eou__ Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . __eou__ You mean you and I ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? __eou__ Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . __eou__ How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? __eou__ First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . __eou__ Would I help you with writing ? __eou__ No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . __eou__ I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? __eou__ Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 __eou__ Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 __eou__ So if you want to meet at 10 __eou__ It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . __eou__ And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . __eou__ Let me give you my phone number . __eou__ Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason .
You know ... I did very poorly on that test . __eou__ Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . __eou__ Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . __eou__ Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school .
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit . __eou__ Are you a professor ? __eou__ What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! __eou__ Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? __eou__ Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk . __eou__ Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . __eou__ My permission letter ? __eou__ Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . __eou__ I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office . __eou__ Yes . Or you can bring it yourself . __eou__ But I asked them to send it to you directly . __eou__ Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it . __eou__ My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R . __eou__ Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request . __eou__ Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ? __eou__ The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__ You're very welcome .
Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . __eou__ Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . __eou__ Do you know about the Bucky Card ? __eou__ I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . __eou__ The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . __eou__ What about beer ? __eou__ The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . __eou__ That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? __eou__ Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . __eou__ And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? __eou__ This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! __eou__ Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card . __eou__ Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . __eou__ But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . __eou__ Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form .
Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! __eou__ Thanks .

Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . __eou__ Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . __eou__ You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . __eou__ Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . __eou__ Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? __eou__ No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . __eou__ Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . __eou__ I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__ So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them .
I wanna register for this mathematics course . __eou__ I ’ m sorry registration has closed . __eou__ Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . __eou__ Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? __eou__ Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee . __eou__ She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ? __eou__ She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . __eou__ Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . __eou__ Serious ? Only the proof of my address . __eou__ Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . __eou__ But it ’ s unfair . __eou__ Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Don ’ t get your hopes up .
Are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money .
Good afternoon , everyone . The experiment is to start at 3 . Have you gone through the instructions ? __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__ Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know . __eou__ Excuse me , sir . This air compressor doesn't work . __eou__ Have you turned it on ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ Ok , I will get you another one . __eou__ Thank you .
This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? __eou__ I'd like to introduce myself first . __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends .
How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . __eou__ Sure , very difficult . __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you .
Hello . __eou__ Mark , this is Lucy . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ I have a friend . He is my best friend and he wants to learn English . He would pay about 100 yuan per hour . Are you interested ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ So I take it you are not interested . __eou__ No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then . __eou__ Don't worry . My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule . __eou__ That will be fine . When can I see him ? __eou__ Let's do it this way . I'll take him to your place this Saturday . Then you two can make a schedule . __eou__ Make sure you come here before noon . I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon . __eou__ How are you going to get there ? __eou__ By bus , of course . __eou__ I am sure my friend can give you a ride . __eou__ Great . By the way , what does your friend do ? __eou__ He is a lawyer . __eou__ Ok , see you then . __eou__ See you .
How many courses do you have for this semester ? __eou__ Eight altogether . __eou__ How are they proportioned ? __eou__ Six are compulsory , two optional .

Bill , your work is too messy . __eou__ I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . __eou__ Is this a promise ? __eou__ Yes , I'm serious this time .
I need some books on hardware . __eou__ There's many books here.What about these ? __eou__ Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? __eou__ Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . __eou__ I see.Thank you .
I've got to go home and study . __eou__ For what ? __eou__ The test tomorrow . __eou__ If you don't know it by now , you might as well not bother studying .
I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . __eou__ Yes , sometimes .
It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ Which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? __eou__ Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America . __eou__ Which university should I apply to ? __eou__ There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you very much .
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time .
I've been looking forward to the new semester . __eou__ I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__ I hear we ’ ll have a new English teacher this semester . __eou__ Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . __eou__ I am sure we will .

I am going to take some university courses there . __eou__ Sounds hard . __eou__ Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . __eou__ Won ’ t you get lonely ? __eou__ Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something .
I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . __eou__ Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on !
Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different . __eou__ Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . __eou__ Great ! Is your , too ? __eou__ Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . __eou__ That's a black fraternity , right ? So we should see some dancing !
Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . __eou__ Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? __eou__ Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . __eou__ Sure . That ’ s not a problem .

You are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start .
How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . __eou__ We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . __eou__ Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? __eou__ If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . __eou__ Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . __eou__ Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__ We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__ I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__ That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . __eou__ A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . __eou__ I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice .
Hey Eve , how are you ? __eou__ I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? __eou__ I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! __eou__ Do you have a lot of homework ? __eou__ Yes .

Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language .
Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? __eou__ That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . __eou__ What was she like ? __eou__ She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . __eou__ What kind of things did you learn ? __eou__ She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . __eou__ Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__ If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . __eou__ You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? __eou__ She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . __eou__ I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . __eou__ Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? __eou__ Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Do you know what she is doing now ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . __eou__ Have you ever read one of the books ? __eou__ Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . __eou__ Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? __eou__ ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time .

I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . __eou__ Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? __eou__ Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . __eou__ You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? __eou__ Oh , yes .
In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . __eou__ Five days a week , too ? __eou__ Actually , five and a half .

Hi , Walter ! __eou__ Hi , Sterling ! __eou__ What do you think of our new teacher ? __eou__ Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . __eou__ You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? __eou__ I guess so .

Even in the same city . __eou__ Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ?

In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so .
Do you offer a course in business management ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ How many nights a week is it ? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . __eou__ And how long does the course last ? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months . __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th . __eou__ What time is the class ? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month . __eou__ Yes , that's all right .

I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .
What courses are you going to take next year ? __eou__ Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I'd like to take English . __eou__ Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ? __eou__ Because I want to study english literature . but I think chemistry is better for getting a job . __eou__ Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ? __eou__ I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist .

Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something !
How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search .
I wish I had access to the public library . __eou__ it's easy ! Just go and get a card .
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . __eou__ Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? __eou__ Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . __eou__ Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ I'm sorry - I still don't understand . __eou__ You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ So , will I be able to find this book ? __eou__ Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__ Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again !
Can I help you ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . __eou__ I'll certainly try to help you.What topic is your paper on ? __eou__ My paper is on the influence of television on children . __eou__ There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . __eou__ Thank you for you help .
Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? __eou__ Certainly . Let me see.Oh , it's on that shelf . __eou__ It's too high . I can't reach it.Could you help me ? __eou__ Of course.Here you are . __eou__ Thank you very much .
How long can I keep these books ? __eou__ A month . Don't forget to return them by the due date . __eou__ What if I can't finish them by then ? __eou__ Bring them back to the circulation desk and renew them . __eou__ Any terrible fines ? __eou__ Sure .
Can I borrow these magazines ? __eou__ Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . __eou__ Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? __eou__ Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students .
Can I help you ? __eou__ Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine ? __eou__ Yes , but it's checked out . __eou__ What a pity ! I missed it again . __eou__ It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book . __eou__ Thank you . What shall I do when I check out these books ? __eou__ Take the card , and fill in your name and library card number . __eou__ Thank you so much .
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two ? __eou__ Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't think they are enough for me . __eou__ Oh , maybe you can find something from the New York Times , or the Washington Post during that period . __eou__ That's a good idea . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome .
This is my admission card , and these are the books . __eou__ OK , a moment , please . __eou__ By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? __eou__ For which one ? __eou__ Sense and Sensibility , English version . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Can I just do it here ? __eou__ Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . __eou__ OK , thanks . __eou__ Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it . __eou__ I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library ... anyway , how much should I pay ? __eou__ 3 Yuan , please . __eou__ Here you are . Thanks . __eou__ You are welcome . See you next time .
Have we handed out all the water ? __eou__ Yes . So what else to do now ? __eou__ Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . __eou__ I see . How do you like the game ? __eou__ Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . __eou__ Who do you think do better ? __eou__ Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . __eou__ Exactly . He is unbelievable . __eou__ On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . __eou__ They were really tough . __eou__ The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . __eou__ I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing .
There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . __eou__ Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . __eou__ I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ? __eou__ It might be the English teacher . What about you ? __eou__ Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . __eou__ She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . __eou__ Yeah , I like her way of teaching .

Could you help me to register for a class ? __eou__ Do you know what class you want to take ? __eou__ Are there any Psychology classes available ? __eou__ I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . __eou__ On what days are the classes ? __eou__ There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . __eou__ Can you tell me about the other class ? __eou__ It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday . __eou__ You're positive that these are the only classes left ? __eou__ These two are the only ones . __eou__ The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine . __eou__ Very good .
Could you help me ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I can't seem to find my class . __eou__ What building is it in ? __eou__ It's in the C building . __eou__ Oh , I know exactly where that is . __eou__ Do you think you can tell me where it is ? __eou__ Sure , what room number is it ? __eou__ It's room number 261 . __eou__ I have a class around there right now . __eou__ Could you show me where it is ? __eou__ No problem , come on .
My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . __eou__ What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! __eou__ The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . __eou__ Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . __eou__ That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . __eou__ Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . __eou__ That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__ I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends !
How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . __eou__ You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! __eou__ I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? __eou__ No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . __eou__ So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . __eou__ You said it .
How are you doing with your English Language studies ? __eou__ I think I'm making good progress . __eou__ Is it harder than you thought ? __eou__ At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun .
I have a real problem when I meet people . __eou__ What is it ? Maybe I can help . __eou__ I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? __eou__ Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . __eou__ It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . __eou__ But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . __eou__ Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . __eou__ That sounds easy enough . __eou__ Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about .
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise !
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress .
Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . __eou__ Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . __eou__ You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! __eou__ Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . __eou__ Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . __eou__ Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ Ok . I will bring it with me .
How long have you been in America ? __eou__ For more than five years . __eou__ Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? __eou__ It's no picnic .
Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ Sure , here you are . __eou__ Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? __eou__ Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . __eou__ Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . __eou__ Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' __eou__ Exactly .
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language .
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . __eou__ Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . __eou__ Is it true or isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Do you want to know something about the American character ? __eou__ I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . __eou__ No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ OK , go on . __eou__ After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? __eou__ Not exactly , but I see your point . __eou__ I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean .
What do you like to do with your free time ? __eou__ Study English . __eou__ You mean you like to study English ? Why ? __eou__ It gives me great satisfaction . __eou__ Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work . __eou__ I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile .
Eric , how long will you be in China ? __eou__ I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? __eou__ How about this sunday ? __eou__ Ok , cool . __eou__ Good . I'll give you a call tonight . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Bye .
Are you studying any languages here ? __eou__ Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . __eou__ What are you majoring in ? __eou__ I'm majoring in English . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . __eou__ Do you know anything about Britain and America ? __eou__ I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . __eou__ Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . __eou__ You're right .
Excuse me , I need your assistance . __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I have no idea where my class is . __eou__ Tell me which building it's in . __eou__ My class is in the C building . __eou__ I know where the C building is . __eou__ Do you mind telling me where it is ? __eou__ Of course , which room number is it ? __eou__ Number 261 . __eou__ I actually have a class right around there . __eou__ Can you please show me ? __eou__ I can do that .
How are your Chinese lessons going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . __eou__ Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . __eou__ Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . __eou__ Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . __eou__ Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese .
How often do you have English lessons ? __eou__ I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . __eou__ How do you practice ? __eou__ I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . __eou__ Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? __eou__ Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends .
Do you mind helping me ? __eou__ What can I help you with ? __eou__ I'm not sure how to find my next class . __eou__ Do you know what building that it's in ? __eou__ The C building , I think . __eou__ Well , that's not far away . __eou__ Could you point me in that direction ? __eou__ Do you know what the room number is ? __eou__ It's C261 . __eou__ My next class is around there . __eou__ Can you show it to me ? __eou__ Sure , let's go .
How do I buy my textbooks ? __eou__ Do you have your book list for your class ? __eou__ Yes , I have my list . __eou__ Fine . Once you have it , you can go to the bookstore . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ Yes , I know where the bookstore is . __eou__ OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? __eou__ No , I didn't know I could do that . __eou__ You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ? __eou__ Yes , I am going today . __eou__ Well , if you decide to go , I could meet you over there at 1 __eou__ Yes , thank you . That would be great . __eou__ Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day !
Where can I buy textbooks ? __eou__ First , you need to have the list of books for your class . Do you have that ? __eou__ Yes , I have that . __eou__ Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ? __eou__ No , I don't know where the bookstore is . __eou__ Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left . Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ? __eou__ Really ? How can I do that ? __eou__ Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ? __eou__ No , I can't make it today . __eou__ I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1 __eou__ No , thanks . I'm good . __eou__ I'll see you later then . Have a great day !
Do you have the notes from last week's class ? __eou__ Did you come late ? __eou__ I couldn't make it . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I was sick . __eou__ Oh , okay . Well , here you go . __eou__ Are these all of them ? __eou__ Oh , wait , here are the rest . __eou__ Thanks a bunch . __eou__ Don't mention it .

Can you mark that on your calendar ? __eou__ Yes , I will write that down . __eou__ That will be Monday , December 2nd . We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 . __eou__ Yes , I will be there on time . __eou__ We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ? __eou__ Yes , someone is coming to get me . __eou__ The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p . m . __eou__ What should we bring with us ? __eou__ I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday !
Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ? __eou__ Sure ! What kind of food would you like ? __eou__ I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian , maybe . __eou__ I know the perfect place ! __eou__ Good ! Where is it ? __eou__ It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ? __eou__ That would be great . __eou__ Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun !
Can you help me buy my textbooks ? __eou__ There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ? __eou__ No , I don't have that . __eou__ To get started , take that list over to the bookstore . Do you know where the bookstore is ? __eou__ I am not sure where the bookstore is . __eou__ When you pass the gym , it'll be the first door on the left . Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? __eou__ Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? __eou__ If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door , he will reimburse you . Can you go over there today ? __eou__ I think maybe I could be there . __eou__ I am free at 1 __eou__ Maybe that would work . __eou__ I'll catch you later then . Have a wonderful morning .
Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? __eou__ Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy that candy . __eou__ OK . So this machine will make change if you need it . Do you have your dollars ready ? __eou__ Yeah , so far , so good . __eou__ Next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . Make sure they are smooth . __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . __eou__ I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck , you might have to re-feed it . __eou__ OK , let's move on ! __eou__ Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . __eou__ I hope it works ! __eou__ Well , good luck !
I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . __eou__ Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? __eou__ I want to buy a drink . __eou__ OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . __eou__ I've got the correct change already . __eou__ First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . __eou__ OK , what next ? __eou__ Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . __eou__ OK , next ? __eou__ Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__ Hope that works for you !
I need to find somewhere to park . __eou__ Off campus or on campus ? __eou__ I need to find a space on campus . __eou__ Why don't you park in the parking structure for students ? __eou__ Where is the parking structure at ? __eou__ It's on the west side of the campus . __eou__ Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ? __eou__ It was empty last time I went up there . __eou__ How long ago was that ? __eou__ I went up there early this morning . __eou__ Do you think it'll be full now ? __eou__ It might be . You'll have to go see for yourself .
I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . __eou__ Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . __eou__ I'm finished . __eou__ I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . __eou__ OK , the form is all filled out . __eou__ Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? __eou__ No , I have no idea what they are . __eou__ Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout . __eou__ Yes , right . __eou__ Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library .
I want to know how to buy something from this machine . __eou__ Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy one of those snack things . __eou__ Are you ready to go ? __eou__ I'm clear so far . __eou__ The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in . __eou__ It won't go in ! __eou__ Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . __eou__ Yes , next step . __eou__ Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . __eou__ They're totally unreliable . __eou__ You seem to have it down . Have a good day !
I really need to find a parking spot . __eou__ Are you looking for a space on or off campus ? __eou__ Do you know any spaces on campus ? __eou__ You can park in the student parking structure . __eou__ Where is it located ? __eou__ You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus . __eou__ Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? __eou__ Last time I checked , it was pretty empty . __eou__ What time was it when you went up there ? __eou__ That was earlier this morning . __eou__ It wouldn't be full right now , would it ? __eou__ I have no idea .
Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card . __eou__ Sure , let me give you an application .

Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week ? __eou__ Were you here last week ? __eou__ I was unable to make it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I was sick that day , and couldn't make it . __eou__ Well , here are the notes . __eou__ Are there any more ? __eou__ Sorry , here you go . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ No problem .
Let me get last week's notes . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you didn't come to class that day ? __eou__ I couldn't come . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I wasn't feeling well . __eou__ Here they are . __eou__ Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes ? __eou__ Oh , no , this is the rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ It's no problem at all .
Excuse me , Professor . I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done . __eou__ What happened that you didn't get it done ? __eou__ I had to watch a football game instead . __eou__ Well , you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ? __eou__ I'll make it up next week . __eou__ Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class . __eou__ OK , I can do that . __eou__ Remember that you are in college now , not high school .
Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ? __eou__ I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? __eou__ I would like to come in at three o'clock . __eou__ I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? __eou__ Yes , I can . __eou__ Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor . __eou__ I got it . __eou__ If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way . __eou__ Thank you , I'll be there . __eou__ If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call !
I don't have my homework today . __eou__ You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? __eou__ I was really sick . __eou__ But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? __eou__ Yes , I probably could . __eou__ You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? __eou__ Next class meeting . __eou__ That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? __eou__ That would work for me . __eou__ Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student .
Let me tell you what happened to my homework . __eou__ OK , go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time ? __eou__ Actually , I did it , but then it got lost . __eou__ Could you have gotten it done at another time ? __eou__ Yes , I could . __eou__ You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up ? __eou__ I'll make it up early next week . __eou__ That would work , but don't let it happen again . __eou__ I'll try . __eou__ That will solve it then . Let's work hard to not let it happen again .
I have to miss school next week . __eou__ Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ? __eou__ Unfortunately , this is what I have to do . __eou__ How are you going to catch up ? __eou__ I've got it all covered . __eou__ If you miss this class , you will have used up your quota for the semester . __eou__ Don't worry , this will be the last class I miss . __eou__ Make sure to remind me right before you are absent . __eou__ I'll remember . __eou__ Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study !
Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Are you in his class ? __eou__ I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . __eou__ He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? __eou__ Yes , I really need someone who is really good . __eou__ I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? __eou__ Maybe , but I'm not sure . __eou__ Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? __eou__ No , that stuff isn't important to me . __eou__ Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? __eou__ I don't care about any of that . __eou__ We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you .
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ? __eou__ I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . __eou__ He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? __eou__ I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . __eou__ Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? __eou__ I really need to learn this stuff . __eou__ He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__ Yes , that sounds right for me . __eou__ Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . __eou__ I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year !
Professor , could I make an appointment with you ? __eou__ I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind ? __eou__ Two o'clock would be the best time . __eou__ Fine , do you know where my office is ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . __eou__ Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Don't worry , it will work out fine once you get there . I'll see you then . __eou__ I'll see you then . __eou__ Looking forward to meeting with you !
Professor , can you help me add your class ? __eou__ You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ? __eou__ No , I will have to get an add sheet . __eou__ You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ No , I don't know where that is . __eou__ The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be . __eou__ I think I can find it . __eou__ You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . __eou__ Thank you for letting me add your class . __eou__ To drop a class , you need to do the same thing with a drop slip . Good luck !
Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today . __eou__ What is the problem ? __eou__ I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative . __eou__ Are you planning on having someone take notes for you ? __eou__ Yes , I've got that part covered . __eou__ When , exactly do you need to leave ? __eou__ I don't need to leave until the very end of class . __eou__ Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again . __eou__ Thanks , Professor . See you later ! __eou__ See you later ! Drive carefully .
I am unsure how to add a class and need help . __eou__ I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? __eou__ Yes , I have an add sheet . __eou__ After I sign it , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . __eou__ When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line . __eou__ Thanks . I understand what to do now . __eou__ It should be easy to find . After you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck !
Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early . __eou__ Why do you have to leave early ? __eou__ I am not feeling well . __eou__ Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ? __eou__ Yes , it's all taken care of . __eou__ Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ? __eou__ I can stay a few more minutes . __eou__ OK , but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed . __eou__ Thanks , Professor . I've got it covered ! __eou__ Go do what you have to do , but make sure it doesn't happen again .
I am not sure how to add a class . __eou__ Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? __eou__ I'll bring one next time . __eou__ When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? __eou__ I think I know where it is . __eou__ Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? __eou__ Thank you for your directions . It's clear . __eou__ You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . __eou__ That's great . Thank you so much . __eou__ Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck !
Where should I park ? __eou__ Do you have a car or motorbike ? __eou__ I drive a scooter __eou__ In that case , you can park either in a student lot or on the street . Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots ? __eou__ No , I haven't seen those spots . __eou__ The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? __eou__ I park in the daytime . __eou__ Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ? __eou__ No , I have not seen the signs . __eou__ Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . Do you know what the curb colors mean ? __eou__ No , I don't know what the curb colors mean . __eou__ Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . I think you'll be good to go !
I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class . __eou__ Where do you need to be that is more important than school ? __eou__ I have an appointment . __eou__ Do you have a plan to make up your missed work ? __eou__ No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . __eou__ Are you going to go right away ? __eou__ I am leaving right now . __eou__ All right , but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up . __eou__ Thanks , Professor . I'll make sure everything gets taken care of . __eou__ Goodbye , and try not to miss any more school .
What is the best place to park ? __eou__ What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ? __eou__ I drive a motorcycle . __eou__ OK . That means you can park in the student lot or on the street . Have you seen the handicapped spots ? __eou__ I am not sure what a handicapped spot is . __eou__ Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces . Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ I park days and evenings . __eou__ Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? __eou__ What signs ? __eou__ As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? __eou__ What curb colors ? __eou__ If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK .
I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester . __eou__ Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ? __eou__ I am a daytime student . __eou__ Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ? __eou__ I will be driving my car . __eou__ OK , that will be twenty-five dollars . How would you like to pay for it ? __eou__ I'll pay for it with a check . __eou__ Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ? __eou__ No , thanks ; I'm fine . __eou__ Here you go then . Have a great school year !
I have an appointment for half past one . __eou__ What can I help you with ? __eou__ Well , I have a problem with my class schedule . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time . __eou__ I can understand the problem with that . __eou__ Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ? __eou__ No problem , do you want those classes still ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day . __eou__ Thank you very much .
I'll need a parking permit for next semester . __eou__ Do you attend school during the day or only at night ? __eou__ I only attend class part-time in the evenings . __eou__ Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile ? __eou__ I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school . __eou__ Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ? __eou__ I'll pay cash . __eou__ Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ OK , here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester .
I want to buy a parking permit , please . __eou__ Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings ? __eou__ I attend both day and evening classes . __eou__ Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ? __eou__ I ride a motorcycle . __eou__ That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card ? __eou__ I'll use a credit card , thank you . __eou__ Do you need a second permit for a car ? __eou__ No , just the motorcycle permit . __eou__ Fine , here it is and have a great semester !

I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . __eou__ Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? __eou__ There's a problem with my schedule . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Two of my classes occur at the same time . __eou__ Well , I can see that's a problem . __eou__ Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? __eou__ Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? __eou__ I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . __eou__ Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . __eou__ Thanks a lot .
Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score . __eou__ Sure . Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ? __eou__ I think that the percentage is incorrect . __eou__ Let's just go over all of it to double-check . __eou__ Sure , let's do it . __eou__ Here is the answer sheet . Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right ? __eou__ I don't see any mistakes . __eou__ OK , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score . __eou__ Yes , let's total it . __eou__ Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ? __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__ Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention .
I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . __eou__ Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? __eou__ I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . __eou__ These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? __eou__ That would be great ! __eou__ Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? __eou__ This one right here should be right . __eou__ Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? __eou__ Yeah , let's do the math . __eou__ I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ? __eou__ Looks pretty good . __eou__ Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying !
Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong . __eou__ What do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? __eou__ Both . __eou__ I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . Will that work for you ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm ready . __eou__ Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . __eou__ These look strange . __eou__ Yes , I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . Would that be OK ? __eou__ OK , let's do the calculation . __eou__ We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask !
I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . __eou__ Grades are based on many things __eou__ What counts the most ? __eou__ Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . __eou__ Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? __eou__ Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . __eou__ What if we miss something ? __eou__ I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . __eou__ Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? __eou__ You will be able to track your progress during the year .
What do you base our grades on ? __eou__ All of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . __eou__ Does the final count the most ? __eou__ All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times . __eou__ How do you total our scores ? __eou__ The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest . __eou__ What if we are out sick ? __eou__ Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence . __eou__ How can we know if we are doing OK during the year ? __eou__ Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on .
I'd like to talk to you about my grades . __eou__ Sure ! What exactly do you have questions about ? __eou__ I am worried that I messed up on a test . __eou__ Well , let me take a look at my grade book . How do YOU think you are doing ? __eou__ I think I am doing great , except for that one test ! __eou__ Well , your scores show that you could do a little better . What do you think you could improve on ? __eou__ I think that I could study a little harder for tests . __eou__ Fine ! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ I'm sure you'll do fine .
What can I help you with today ? __eou__ I need to check out this book . __eou__ Do you have your library card ? __eou__ I don ’ t have one . __eou__ Would you like to apply for one right now ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ I ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . __eou__ All right .

Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Of course , how can I help you ? __eou__ I want to know if I am doing OK . __eou__ Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ? __eou__ I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well . __eou__ I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . __eou__ I think I could take better notes and read a little more . __eou__ You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . __eou__ I'm working on it ! __eou__ Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement .
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? __eou__ Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? __eou__ Am I failing ? __eou__ Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? __eou__ I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . __eou__ I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? __eou__ I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . __eou__ Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? __eou__ I'll try ; it's hard ! __eou__ Thanks for stopping by !

It's not an easy decision to make . __eou__ if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed .

Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ? __eou__ I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying . __eou__ I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . __eou__ that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better .

How did you do that ? __eou__ well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages . __eou__ that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ? __eou__ I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . __eou__ when did you take your exams ? __eou__ about two weeks ago . __eou__ how do you think you did ? __eou__ I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . __eou__ I'm sure you'll do well .

If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . __eou__ what's that for ? __eou__ one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . __eou__ do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? __eou__ sure .

Which one is the cheapest ? __eou__ the tuition is the same for all of them . __eou__ which one has the most interesting course ? __eou__ I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . __eou__ where would you like to be located ? __eou__ I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . __eou__ have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? __eou__ not yet . __eou__ I think you should do that soon .

Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . __eou__ Do you have a clear career path to follow ? __eou__ career path ? I'm not sure . __eou__ what kind of job do you want after graduation ? __eou__ I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... __eou__ wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? __eou__ yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . __eou__ I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . __eou__ no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working __eou__ thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over .
how was your education going on in Australia ? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation . __eou__ why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__ absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . __eou__ the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home . __eou__ that's right . Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China .
I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . __eou__ but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . __eou__ I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . __eou__ it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . __eou__ you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . __eou__ it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . __eou__ yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . __eou__ that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? __eou__ well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . __eou__ sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company .

Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? __eou__ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ That ’ s right !

This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns .
Joan is a thorough drag ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ She keeps talking when I'm reading . __eou__ There must be something wrong with her .
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__ Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__ You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__ Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight .
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart .
Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? __eou__ He has no sense . __eou__ If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money . __eou__ But Joe won't you .
Tom , is Jenny crying ? __eou__ Can you take he away from me ? __eou__ I ’ m just coming for that . __eou__ She kept on bothering me . __eou__ She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? __eou__ But I am her brother , not her servant .
Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . __eou__ I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my sister , you know .
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . __eou__ He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . __eou__ When we were students , he was no good in any subject . __eou__ It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case .
Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . __eou__ Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it .
Your ring is very beautiful . __eou__ Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . __eou__ Oh , it is precious . __eou__ It surely is .
I have a bone to pick with you . __eou__ Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? __eou__ You always have a chip on your shoulder . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat .
Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . __eou__ How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . __eou__ But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first .
That ’ s really a let-down . __eou__ Yeah . He really does let me down . __eou__ But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . __eou__ I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas .
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday .
It ’ s really terrible ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? __eou__ Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . __eou__ You said it . Many parents just don ’ t understand know how to educate their children .
What is wrong with your face ? __eou__ My brother did it . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it .
Why do you look so sad ? __eou__ I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . __eou__ Why not go and see a doctor ? __eou__ I never trust those stupid doctors .

I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . __eou__ It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . __eou__ Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . __eou__ That's quite a compliment coming from you .
Hi . __eou__ Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... __eou__ Yeah ? __eou__ You were playing it very late last night . __eou__ It kept me awake . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . __eou__ It kept me awake a couple of hours . __eou__ I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud . __eou__ It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me . __eou__ It's true.It was a bit loud . __eou__ I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . __eou__ Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . __eou__ I am glad we've straightened everything out .
How do you do , Prof.Smith . __eou__ How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English . __eou__ Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country . __eou__ It's amazing .

You're late . __eou__ I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ My phone ? __eou__ Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__ But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . __eou__ About what ? __eou__ You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ Do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__ Yes , let's go .
Can I borrow some money from you ? __eou__ No way !
Ah ! No ! Damn it ! __eou__ It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . __eou__ So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . __eou__ Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? __eou__ No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . __eou__ I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . __eou__ I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . __eou__ What are we going to do now ? __eou__ I don't know . I feel like going out . __eou__ I wonder how much of the city is down . __eou__ It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . __eou__ Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . __eou__ Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__ I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .
I got a raise . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that .
Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It's a boy .
Congratulations ! You've just won a car ! __eou__ It's too good to be true .
Bob , I'm really upset with you . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . __eou__ You forgot it last year as well . __eou__ I know , I'm sorry .
Mary , be calm . __eou__ It is impossible . You cheated on me . __eou__ No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you . __eou__ Shut up ! __eou__ No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... __eou__ But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . __eou__ OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . __eou__ Leave me ! Go away !
Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? __eou__ Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__ And , her lips ? __eou__ Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . __eou__ And her voice like a lark's song ? __eou__ Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . __eou__ Oh , she sings too ? __eou__ Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear .
How could you have done that without asking me first ? __eou__ I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it . __eou__ Well , you should have thought . __eou__ I'm sorry . I'll ask next time .
Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea .
You're my hero . __eou__ Aw , shucks , ma'am .
Guess what I've brought for you . __eou__ Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right .
Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true .
I'm afraid I've spilt ink all over the table-cloth . __eou__ Oh , never mind about that . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry . Won't you let me pay for it ? __eou__ No , I won't hear of it .
Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . __eou__ Congratulations . That's great ! __eou__ I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . __eou__ When do you start ? __eou__ I start next Monday . __eou__ You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . __eou__ I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . __eou__ I bet . You must be stoked . __eou__ Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? __eou__ Sure . It's on you right ? __eou__ Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? __eou__ I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . __eou__ I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea .
Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . __eou__ Great ! This calls for a celebration .
I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . __eou__ But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . __eou__ However , he disappointed us very much this time . __eou__ I can understand that . But ...
Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? __eou__ The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__ Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . __eou__ But this chance is really precious . __eou__ Well , I know . So I am thinking now . __eou__ I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully .
I don't want to do the damn dishes . __eou__ Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room .
The teacher should give us more time to complete this assignment . __eou__ You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week .
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise .
Look at that pretty girl . __eou__ Wow ! She's gorgeous .
That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it when I was on vacation in Nepal .
You look like being on cloud nine . __eou__ I am . __eou__ What has made you so happy ? __eou__ I think I'm in love . __eou__ Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? __eou__ Her name is Jenny . __eou__ How did you meet her ? __eou__ We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . __eou__ What do you like best about her ? __eou__ She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . __eou__ I guess it was fate working to bring you together . __eou__ Whatever brought us together , I'm happy .
I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . __eou__ Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ? __eou__ What of it ? __eou__ Sure .
Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . __eou__ Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . __eou__ Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . __eou__ No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . __eou__ Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . __eou__ It's a promise .
Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? __eou__ Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . __eou__ No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . __eou__ Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . __eou__ Well , a good teacher makes good students . __eou__ You are quite right .
Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . __eou__ Thank you . I was lucky this time . __eou__ I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . __eou__ I am flattered . __eou__ It is real word . __eou__ Thank you very much .
I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! __eou__ Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . __eou__ When are you going ? __eou__ Sometime next month .
I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud . __eou__ Sorry . Were you trying to sleep ? __eou__ Yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time . __eou__ I'm sorry . You're right . I should have asked .
I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . __eou__ I will try my best .
You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? __eou__ Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . __eou__ I'm sorry . I meant to ask you .
That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ? __eou__ Sorry . Was I disturbing you ? __eou__ Yes . And something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . __eou__ Sorry . I guess I wasn't thinking . I won't do it again .
I've got a complaint about the noise next door . __eou__ Yes , it's most irritating . __eou__ Some people aren't very considerate . __eou__ We're going to do something about it . __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ We can't put up with it any more . __eou__ We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ? __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ What should we do ? __eou__ Why don't we call them ? __eou__ Good idea .
Do you think you could keep the noise down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? __eou__ Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind .
Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? __eou__ I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . __eou__ You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? __eou__ That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . __eou__ Did you tell your parents yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . __eou__ They're probably going to be so happy . __eou__ I think so . It's turning out to be a great day .
You seem really ticked off . What's up ? __eou__ Just get out of my face , would you ? __eou__ Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? __eou__ Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything ! __eou__ Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . __eou__ Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? __eou__ She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . __eou__ Get out of here ! __eou__ I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ __eou__ Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross !
Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school . __eou__ Wow , that's great !
Jack , what's wrong ? __eou__ You ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? What did I do ? __eou__ You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? __eou__ No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . __eou__ She started feeling suspicious after you said that . __eou__ I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . __eou__ Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . __eou__ Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . __eou__ Don't bother .
I'm sorry I'm late . __eou__ Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you . __eou__ The bus I took . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I took the wrong bus . __eou__ Oh , did you ? That's very easy to do .
Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes , the fried chicken is too hard to eat . I suggest you bring me another one free of charge . __eou__ Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here . __eou__ OK . I will talk to him direcly .
I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Where is she going to college ? __eou__ She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . __eou__ Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !
David , why don't you clean your room ? __eou__ I am not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh , I just can't forget it .
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I am impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . __eou__ Thanks . Does it suit me ? __eou__ Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . __eou__ I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . __eou__ And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . __eou__ It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . __eou__ Thank you for saying so .
You ’ re making my blood boil . __eou__ Calm down . Madam . __eou__ I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . __eou__ I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems . __eou__ Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? __eou__ I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__ Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__ If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out .
Look what you've done ! __eou__ I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . __eou__ Yes , and hurry up ! __eou__ I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? __eou__ No , I'll do it myself . __eou__ Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? __eou__ I should think so , too ! __eou__ I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . __eou__ Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! __eou__ I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . __eou__ That's OK .

I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir .
Are you an American ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you speak English ? __eou__ Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . __eou__ Oh , do you like Chinese ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . __eou__ I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? __eou__ Very Good . I'd like to do that . __eou__ When will we begin ? __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ That's all right .
Does she make any sense to you ? __eou__ No . It's all Greek to me . __eou__ She's speaking French , not Greek . __eou__ I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . __eou__ Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . __eou__ I wish you the best of luck .
Are you a newcomer ? __eou__ Yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ You speak good English , though . __eou__ Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . __eou__ But let me tell you , you're doing just fine .

Are you new here ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I actually transferred here from another school . __eou__ Which school ? __eou__ I transferred from PCC . __eou__ How do you like it here compared to PCC ? __eou__ I love it here . __eou__ Do you like it better here or at PCC ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong . I like it here , but PCC is better . __eou__ So , why did you leave PCC ? __eou__ Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree .
You must be new . __eou__ As a matter of fact , I am . __eou__ Have you just started college ? __eou__ No . I transferred here from a different school . __eou__ What school ? __eou__ I transferred here from PCC . __eou__ Do you like it here ? __eou__ I really like it here so far . __eou__ Do you like it better here or at PCC ? __eou__ I like PCC better . __eou__ If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? __eou__ I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree .

You ’ re ready , right ? __eou__ Ready for what ? __eou__ Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I am ready . __eou__ You ’ re not nervous ? __eou__ Of course I ’ m nervous . __eou__ What are you most nervous about ? __eou__ I won ’ t know anybody at that school . __eou__ You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Meeting new people is a good thing . __eou__ That ’ s a good way to think about it .
Are you new to this school ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m new . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I transferred from another school . __eou__ Where did you transfer from ? __eou__ I was at PCC before . __eou__ Why did you transfer ? __eou__ I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Did you like it at PCC ? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school . __eou__ Well , I wish you luck here . __eou__ I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here .
You ’ re new here , right ? __eou__ Yes , I am new . __eou__ Is this your first semester ? __eou__ I just transferred from another school . __eou__ What school did you transfer from ? __eou__ I came here from PCC . __eou__ Do you like it here so far ? __eou__ I am really enjoying it here so far . __eou__ Which is better , here or PCC ? __eou__ I think PCC is a lot better than here . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ? __eou__ I graduated and now want to get a BA .
Are you new here ? __eou__ This is my first day here . __eou__ Are you a freshman in college ? __eou__ I started school somewhere else . __eou__ What school did you transfer from ? __eou__ I started at PCC . __eou__ What made you transfer ? __eou__ My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . __eou__ Did you like PCC ? __eou__ I loved PCC . __eou__ Good luck here . __eou__ I ’ m excited to be here .
Where are you planning on transferring to ? __eou__ I can ’ t seem to make a decision . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I honestly have no idea . __eou__ You haven ’ t thought about it ? __eou__ I like it here at PCC . __eou__ Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? __eou__ I like that idea . __eou__ It ’ s a great school . __eou__ I completely agree . __eou__ So , have you made your decision yet ? __eou__ I ’ m staying right where I ’ m at .
You ready ? __eou__ Am I ready for what ? __eou__ Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . __eou__ You ’ re not nervous , are you ? __eou__ I ’ m very nervous . __eou__ Why are you nervous ? __eou__ I ’ m not going to know anybody there . __eou__ That ’ s not a problem . __eou__ That makes me nervous . __eou__ It ’ s fun meeting new people . __eou__ I didn ’ t think about it that way .
Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I can ’ t think of where to go . __eou__ Where would you like to go to school ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . __eou__ You can ’ t think of anything ? __eou__ I really like where I ’ m at now . __eou__ So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? __eou__ That may be what I ’ m going to do . __eou__ It ’ s a perfectly good school . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to stay at PCC .
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . __eou__ As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . __eou__ Who was chairing the meeting ? __eou__ Bob . __eou__ Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . __eou__ That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . __eou__ What was the meeting about ? __eou__ We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . __eou__ It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . __eou__ Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? __eou__ You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . __eou__ Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? __eou__ You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . __eou__ That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting .
Hi , Dave . This is Zina . __eou__ Zina ? Zina the Snake ? __eou__ I got your e-mail a couple of months back . __eou__ Yeah ? Which one was that ? __eou__ The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . __eou__ Right . That one . Did it work ?
I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . __eou__ Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . __eou__ I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... __eou__ ... and maybe that's what we both need . __eou__ I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__ OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too .
Oh , no . It looks like we're late . __eou__ Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . __eou__ There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? __eou__ They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . __eou__ That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . __eou__ Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening !
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ?
Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . __eou__ I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one .
Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me .
Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . __eou__ It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . __eou__ All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . __eou__ It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . __eou__ Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . __eou__ That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved .
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it .
Harry was angry last night . __eou__ That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . __eou__ But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . __eou__ Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason .
He got the scholarship to Harvard . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ It's true . He is a hard worker . __eou__ I know he really deserves this .
I don't like this movie . It's a bomb . __eou__ Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . __eou__ Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . __eou__ Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started .
My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . __eou__ Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . __eou__ How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! __eou__ It spoiled my painting !
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
What do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care .
You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? __eou__ I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . __eou__ I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , too good to be true .
When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ The last straw , huh ? __eou__ Yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ I know what you mean .
I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ There's no need to apologize . __eou__ But I ruined your rug . __eou__ Forget it . It was an accident .
You didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__ I tried . You were preoccupied . __eou__ I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! __eou__ You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . __eou__ That guy was definitely a Don . __eou__ So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . __eou__ Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back .
Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . __eou__ My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . __eou__ No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? __eou__ Yes , I have . But I have to wait .
Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! __eou__ What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . __eou__ No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! __eou__ You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want .
It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . __eou__ Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__ This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__ I'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__ But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? __eou__ You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ...
You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? __eou__ Why am I always the last to know these things ? __eou__ I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? __eou__ No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . __eou__ How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . __eou__ He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him !
You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days . __eou__ And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves . __eou__ But you're not to blame for them keeping him there . __eou__ Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy . __eou__ Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry .
I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . __eou__ It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there .
Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? __eou__ No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... __eou__ It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... __eou__ They're going to give us back the seats ? __eou__ No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... __eou__ Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? __eou__ You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . __eou__ Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful !
Thanks for helping me up . __eou__ Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . __eou__ I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over ! __eou__ That takes talent ... __eou__ I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing ! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies .
What ? I don't get it ... __eou__ Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . __eou__ Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy . __eou__ He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . __eou__ I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... __eou__ Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek !
Excuse me , Supen . __eou__ I hope nothing is wrong . __eou__ Please forgive me , but I have to leave . I feel terrible . but ... __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ My daughter isn't feeling well . __eou__ Oh , no . Is it serious ? __eou__ I don't know . Will you forgive me ? __eou__ Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . __eou__ Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . __eou__ Not at all .
How are you , Sue ? __eou__ Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s your brother ? __eou__ He is fine . __eou__ He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . __eou__ Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed .
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .
What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel .
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right .
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it .
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? __eou__ I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__ I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh . I just can ’ t forget it .
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need .
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__ By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . __eou__ Good , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? __eou__ Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure .
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to .
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you .
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . __eou__ I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__ You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__ I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__ I hate it . __eou__ Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried .
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by us . __eou__ Well , you always say you're busy . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . __eou__ I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . __eou__ Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . __eou__ You mean I am groaned a few words ? __eou__ Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage .
I have a problem . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ The delivery people showed up four hours late . __eou__ I apologize for their tardiness . __eou__ I was late for work because of them . __eou__ Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__ Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__ It shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ I'm going to refund your money right now .
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more !
Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . __eou__ Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . __eou__ How ’ s that going ? __eou__ It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . __eou__ Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? __eou__ No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . __eou__ I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . __eou__ Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters .
Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! __eou__ Is everything OK ? __eou__ Just get over here ! __eou__ Come in ! Quickly ! __eou__ So , since when is your house a bank ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . __eou__ Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__ Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__ OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__ You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful !
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ Then what shall I do ? __eou__ Call the police .
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point .
Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . __eou__ You are so thoughtful .
I think that ’ s settled . __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ Why not ?
What are you thinking about ? __eou__ About my boyfriend . __eou__ Again ! __eou__ You are really a wet blanket .
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__ Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__ You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__ Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight .
John's father got married again . __eou__ Married whom ? __eou__ If I tell you . , you must be completely taken aback . __eou__ Come on . Tell me what happened . __eou__ He married a girl who is only eighteen ! __eou__ Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ?
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . __eou__ I hope so .
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart .
You seem to have all the jitters about Jane . __eou__ Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match . __eou__ Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon . __eou__ I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her .
Are you an American ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you speak English ? __eou__ Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . __eou__ Oh , do you like Chinese ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . __eou__ I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? __eou__ Very Good . I'd like to do that . __eou__ When will we begin ? __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ That's all right .
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ?
I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . __eou__ You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again . __eou__ I hope so . But I'm always caught short . __eou__ But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table .
Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . __eou__ Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? __eou__ Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . __eou__ But my father did not . He didn't have much time . __eou__ Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . __eou__ Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . __eou__ It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . __eou__ Can I see the rainbow ? __eou__ That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks .
What courses are you taking ? __eou__ Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . __eou__ What do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! __eou__ That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? __eou__ Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . __eou__ What is he like ? __eou__ He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . __eou__ Are you able to follow him ? __eou__ Not everything , but nearly .

John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . __eou__ Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . __eou__ Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . __eou__ Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . __eou__ Would you like to clear the table then ? __eou__ Really ? Do I have to do it ? __eou__ Not , if you don ’ t want to . __eou__ Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? __eou__ Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? __eou__ No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood .
Do you love me ? __eou__ I ’ m very fond of you . __eou__ Yes , but do you love me ? __eou__ why ? You mean a lot to me . __eou__ why didn ’ t you answer my question ? __eou__ what question ? __eou__ Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . __eou__ you know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I---I don ’ t feel like saying it .
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ Maybe it was Dick . __eou__ I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that . __eou__ Then it must be a naughty boy who did it .
How did Jim get the money ? __eou__ He borrowed it from Nick . __eou__ He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . __eou__ He was too desperate to find some other way .
Would you like a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes . That would be good . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ This machine is out of order . __eou__ You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ? __eou__ I sure did . __eou__ You ought to complain . These machine are always out of order .
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect . Couldn't be better ! __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I wanted . __eou__ No regrets ? __eou__ I'm really pleased with it . Thanks . __eou__ I'm glad you're so happy . __eou__ It's super .
Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . __eou__ Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ He ’ s nearly 90 . __eou__ Good gracious ! Are you sure ? __eou__ I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . __eou__ Is she really ? __eou__ Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . __eou__ Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ?
Listen to this . Mary got married . __eou__ Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ Yes . Yesterday . __eou__ Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! __eou__ She married Jerrod . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . __eou__ She ’ s going to live in Paris . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised .
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no !
Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? __eou__ Stay away from me . __eou__ Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? __eou__ I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . __eou__ That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . __eou__ Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you .
How are Zina's new programmers working out ? __eou__ I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . __eou__ So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? __eou__ It'll be close , but we'll make it . __eou__ Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . __eou__ And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either .
Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? __eou__ You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . __eou__ Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . __eou__ You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . __eou__ Did you hear the names he was calling me ? __eou__ I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ?
There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . __eou__ What ? __eou__ She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . __eou__ What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? __eou__ Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . __eou__ Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho !
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault .
Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Did you have the room checked before we move in ? __eou__ Which room are you in ? __eou__ 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . __eou__ I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away .
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__ How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__ It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow .
My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race . __eou__ Excuse me.What did you say ? __eou__ A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games __eou__ That's incredible . I cann't believe it . __eou__ You have to . It's sure . __eou__ How amazing !
You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .
I really need a new pair of trousers . __eou__ Do you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . This one is very old now . __eou__ They look all right to me . __eou__ They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible . __eou__ All right . All right .
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? __eou__ I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__ I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh . I just can ’ t forget it .
What he said disappointed me . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He advised me to change to a more suitable course . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . __eou__ It is stupid to say so .
Mum , can I finish my homework later ? __eou__ Sorry . You know the rules . __eou__ But I want to watch TV now . __eou__ That ’ s out of the question . __eou__ Please . __eou__ Not a chance . __eou__ Not even for an hour ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s impossible .
Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes , please . That is very kind of you . __eou__ Shall I make more sandwiches ? __eou__ No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty .
Good morning , Loans . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ I would like to compliment you on your diligence . __eou__ Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . __eou__ Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so .
Listen to this . Mary got married . __eou__ Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ Yes . Yesterday . __eou__ Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! __eou__ She married Jerrod . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . __eou__ She ’ s going to live in Paris . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised .
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no !
Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? __eou__ It's an excellent one . I like it very much . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . __eou__ I agree with you .
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good.Let ' s go now . __eou__ All right .
What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__ It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__ Sure .
Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . __eou__ How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . __eou__ But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first .
Hi , Becky , what's up ? __eou__ Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . __eou__ No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__ You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? __eou__ We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
Do you have to leave soon ? __eou__ No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . __eou__ Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . __eou__ He knows you very well . __eou__ He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . __eou__ I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . __eou__ No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously .
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training .
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__ You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ Where it is ? __eou__ It's a private garden .
They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it .
Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don ’ t want to . __eou__ Well , come and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the radio then ? __eou__ Turn on the radio ? What for ? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? __eou__ Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? __eou__ Promise you are not going to be angry ? __eou__ Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? __eou__ I forgot . __eou__ You forgot ? You ... __eou__ Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
Er ... Alison ? __eou__ Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... __eou__ I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . __eou__ Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... __eou__ It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! __eou__ Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed .
Would you like a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes.That would be good . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ This machine is out of order . __eou__ You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? __eou__ I sure did . __eou__ You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order .
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream .
You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__ Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__ They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__ They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
I don't think the lecture is very interesting . __eou__ The lecturer is dull , too . __eou__ I feel he's like a talking machine . __eou__ I feel the same way .
Are you there , Mary ? __eou__ I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! __eou__ How much is my stamp ? __eou__ Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? __eou__ Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . __eou__ His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes .
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people .
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I am impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken ! __eou__ I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it . __eou__ You have a real talent , Ellen ! __eou__ I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know .
I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! __eou__ So glad that you think so ! __eou__ I think you deserve a promotion . __eou__ Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess .
How's your new apartment ? __eou__ I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ One of my neighbors has a dog . __eou__ Does it make a lot of noise ? __eou__ It barks all night long .
You're going to abandon me , just like that ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do .
When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . __eou__ You only need to tell me that once .
I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . __eou__ I agree with you , but that's easier said than done .
One of my students told me she was very depressed today . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Her father is dying . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s very sad . __eou__ Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . __eou__ Yeah , me too .
Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . __eou__ Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . __eou__ Why are we watching it anyway ? __eou__ Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . __eou__ True . True . __eou__ Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? __eou__ Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ You want something to drink ? __eou__ Yeah , Got a Coke ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Hurry , the movie is coming back on .
Did you hear what she said to me ? __eou__ I heard it . __eou__ What do you think I should do about it ? __eou__ Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her .
How would you like your hair cut ? __eou__ I want it short . __eou__ Then , I'll just trim it . __eou__ It will do .
Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ’ s very worried . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry I ’ m late . But Henry ’ s car broke down . __eou__ I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose . __eou__ I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . __eou__ But my Rose is great . __eou__ Your Rose is a fool . __eou__ Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . __eou__ Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ?
Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ? __eou__ You don ’ t love me , Roy . __eou__ Why do you say such words ? I love you very much . __eou__ No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . __eou__ Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . __eou__ I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . __eou__ Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . __eou__ Oh , shut up , Roy . __eou__ But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... __eou__ Oh , SHUT UP !
Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown . __eou__ Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University . __eou__ Yes , we are very proud of her . __eou__ Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ? __eou__ Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? __eou__ No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector . __eou__ I'd like to see that myself . __eou__ Have a wallet size print made for me , too . __eou__ Certainly .
She is so stupid . __eou__ Who cares ? She is pretty . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ You're just jealous .
Did you see that ? __eou__ No , I missed it . __eou__ How could you miss that ? __eou__ Someone was in the way .
Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . __eou__ I know only too well what that's like . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was very sad when I was laid off last year .
When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ The last straw , huh ? __eou__ Yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ I know what you mean .
I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ There's no need to apologize . __eou__ But I ruined your rug . __eou__ Forget it . It was an accident .
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care .
Are things still going badly with your house guest ? __eou__ It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed .
Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? __eou__ I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . __eou__ Oh you ’ re so kind ! __eou__ Get in .
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ You think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ That wouldn ’ t be a lie !
So , what happened ? __eou__ He never came . __eou__ He stood you up . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction .
If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up . __eou__ Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . __eou__ No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . __eou__ That ’ d be fine .
How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it .
I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble . __eou__ That ’ s alright .
I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s alright . __eou__ I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . __eou__ No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that .
I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . __eou__ I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . __eou__ Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . __eou__ Have you found anything yet ? __eou__ You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? __eou__ You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . __eou__ I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem . __eou__ But the parking might be . __eou__ You bet !
Would you mind doing something for me ? __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? __eou__ Yes , With pleasure .
Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers __eou__ Until when ? __eou__ Until Monday or Tuesday next week . __eou__ No problem .
Adam . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Well . You ’ re here .
This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? __eou__ A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . __eou__ Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . __eou__ Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . __eou__ Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? __eou__ Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . __eou__ Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . __eou__ Cut out , would you ?
So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . __eou__ You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . __eou__ I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike .
God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... __eou__ ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . __eou__ You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . __eou__ Why would I spy on you ? __eou__ Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . __eou__ The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . __eou__ What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? __eou__ Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year .
You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? __eou__ Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . __eou__ It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... __eou__ Are you done ?
I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . __eou__ Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? __eou__ But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . __eou__ Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do .
I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . __eou__ I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . __eou__ Oh , you poor thing !
Many congratulations on your winning the game . __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . __eou__ You were doing great out there ! __eou__ Well , actually it ’ s just about luck .
How's your new work , Carl ? __eou__ A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . __eou__ Well , you have to take the bad with the good . __eou__ I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job .
Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . __eou__ Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__ Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . __eou__ Maybe by then it will be too late . __eou__ What do you mean too late ? __eou__ By that time , you will be fired .
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting .
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect ! Couldn't be better . __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I want . __eou__ No regrets . __eou__ I am really pleased with it . __eou__ I am glad you are happy . __eou__ It's super .
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise .
Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . __eou__ Oh , How annoying ! __eou__ The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . __eou__ It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five .
Hey , sorry to be late . __eou__ What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . __eou__ My mother was ill . I had to look after her . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry to hear that .
Excuse me , I wonder if you could help me ? __eou__ Of course , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . __eou__ Oh , what exactly is problem ? __eou__ Well , the traffic is very loud . I got no sleep last night . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry , Sir . I'll see what I can do about that .
Is anything the matter , sir ? __eou__ Yes , it's my steak . __eou__ What's wrong with it , sir ? __eou__ It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . __eou__ I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? __eou__ Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . __eou__ I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? __eou__ Yes , please give me another Calsberg . __eou__ Can I bring you some dessert ? __eou__ No , thank you . I've had enough . __eou__ How about some coffee or tea then ? __eou__ Yes , I will have a cup of coffee .
Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small . __eou__ Do you have the receipt with you ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Thank you . Do you want your money back ? __eou__ No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? __eou__ I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . __eou__ Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger .
Hello , Is this EYE computers ? __eou__ Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ? __eou__ Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ? __eou__ Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . __eou__ Oh , dear ! I'll do well I can .
I must apologize for having delayed the work . __eou__ No , that ’ s not all your fault . __eou__ But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry __eou__ There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it .
We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . __eou__ That's absolutely ridiculous !
I hate to see the abuse of animals . __eou__ It makes me sick .
I really dislike reading academic books . __eou__ That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge .
The academy is an important part of the education system . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more .
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to .
I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! __eou__ Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally . __eou__ Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ? __eou__ Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please ! __eou__ Well . Since you ’ d like an honest answer , I will tell you the truth . __eou__ Alright . What is that you want to tell me ? __eou__ We ’ Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation ! __eou__ What ? Are you serious ? Oh , my gosh ! There will be guys everywhere .
Eric , how long will you be in China ? __eou__ I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? __eou__ How about this sunday ? __eou__ Ok , cool . __eou__ Good . I'll give you a call tonight . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Bye .
David , why don't you clean your room ? __eou__ I am not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depress ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . __eou__ I don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh , I just can't forget it .
The concert was really great . __eou__ I agree . __eou__ The singing group used to be very popular . __eou__ I can't believe they would play so good .
Thanks for lunch . It was delicious . __eou__ It's OK . __eou__ Next time lunch is on me . __eou__ Don't be silly . __eou__ I'm serious . __eou__ All right . Next time you will treat . __eou__ It's a deal .
Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . __eou__ Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . __eou__ Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . __eou__ Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker !
Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ? __eou__ No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more . __eou__ I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ? __eou__ I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack . __eou__ You are welcome .
Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__ Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! __eou__ Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work !
Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? __eou__ I can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . __eou__ My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . __eou__ True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? __eou__ It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__ Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ You're dancing so well . __eou__ You dance beautifully too . __eou__ When did you learn to dance ? __eou__ In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .
And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! __eou__ Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! __eou__ And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__ You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__ I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . __eou__ You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike !
I always think everybody looks down on me __eou__ Don't be that negative . __eou__ How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . __eou__ I find it there is no meaning in living this world . __eou__ Really , life is so boring .
I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__ At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__ That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? __eou__ I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . __eou__ I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . __eou__ Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine .
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training .
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something !
I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__ Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__ Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry .
She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! __eou__ Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__ Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__ She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . __eou__ They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . __eou__ That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ?
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__ That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__ Definitely , I ’ m really sorry .
You look really wiped out ? __eou__ I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__ Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight .
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ No , I'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ Don't make a fuss.The price is rising
How delicious ! Tender and crisp ! __eou__ This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . __eou__ Yes , it's really savory . __eou__ Thank you for appreciating it .
What a pin-up she is ! __eou__ Can you imagine she's over forty ? __eou__ That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . __eou__ Absolutely.She ' s a teacher of aerobics .
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it .
Let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ Never mind .
She's pretty and meek . __eou__ No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my wife , you know .
Look out ! __eou__ What's it ? __eou__ You must have rolled over something just now . __eou__ What you said gives me the creeps !
What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__ It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! __eou__ Thank you.You ' re partial . __eou__ I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . __eou__ It's nice to hear that anyway .
I'm scared that she might not come back . __eou__ No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . __eou__ But she took her luggage away with her . __eou__ She will be back soon.You can wait and see .
I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . __eou__ I'll teach you how to keep her . __eou__ Tell me , please . __eou__ After you've solved this problem for me .
Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . __eou__ The beauty under the tree ? __eou__ Of course.No girl is more charming . __eou__ She is a young man !
I hear little Bob has recovered . __eou__ That's a great relief . I was worried about him . __eou__ The operation was very successful . __eou__ His parents must feel very happy .
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed .
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me .
Crazy ! He locked himself in the room . __eou__ I think he was locked in it . __eou__ But you can see the key in his hand through the window ! __eou__ What a strange guy !
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__ Oh , but why ? __eou__ I feel they're dirty .
How do you feel about the TV series ? __eou__ Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__ Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__ But I don't think much of it .
Every teacher likes him . __eou__ They say he can sum up like winking . __eou__ How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . __eou__ Maybe he's gifted in that .
How much did you bid ? __eou__ Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! __eou__ We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! __eou__ But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . __eou__ What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? __eou__ You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know .
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . __eou__ It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . __eou__ Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . __eou__ That's true .
What's that ? __eou__ It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? __eou__ Is that Hello Kitty ? __eou__ Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! __eou__ Is it real gold ? __eou__ Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow .
Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? __eou__ Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! __eou__ How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . __eou__ Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... __eou__ Look , it's starting ! __eou__ Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ?
This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . __eou__ Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had .
Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ? __eou__ He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while . __eou__ That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some . __eou__ Make it three cups . Here comes Harry .
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__ Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel .
Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . __eou__ Birds of a feather flock together .
isn't it wonderful walking here ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us . __eou__ yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? __eou__ quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark __eou__ what's there after that ? __eou__ well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ what are all they for ? __eou__ most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . __eou__ I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . __eou__ don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . __eou__ really ? I thought you hated shopping ? __eou__ I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__ sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on . __eou__ how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you . __eou__ that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__ here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__ I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? __eou__ let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . __eou__ this is perfect ! What do you think ? __eou__ I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! __eou__ I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey !
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? __eou__ Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__ Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening !
Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? __eou__ A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi .
You are late . What ’ s the deal ? __eou__ Sorry , I was delayed by something and stuck in traffic .
Oh , no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project . __eou__ Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around .
You have your ducks in a row . __eou__ Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work .
You are an eager beaver . __eou__ Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life .
Mom . My legs are killing me . __eou__ Hold on . We will be successful right away .
Let ’ s cross here . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light . __eou__ Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . __eou__ If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters !
Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . __eou__ Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful . __eou__ So I'd rather walk or run to work . __eou__ You must be joking !
What's all this noise about ? __eou__ They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because she's not responsible enough .
Do you like playing tennis ? __eou__ I don't find it very exciting . __eou__ Maybe you haven't found the magic . __eou__ I can't wait !
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__ Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__ But a taxi costs too much . __eou__ That's true .
I'm tired of dancing . __eou__ But to me it's really enjoyable . __eou__ Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners . __eou__ Maybe so .
I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . __eou__ Young people enjoy pop songs more . __eou__ It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . __eou__ But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs .
What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . __eou__ But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . __eou__ I don't care ! __eou__ You're complaining again .
Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . __eou__ So what are you trying to say to me ? __eou__ It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . __eou__ How should I say it ? __eou__ I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . __eou__ It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . __eou__ It was only the cheek . __eou__ That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . __eou__ Oh , that is ridiculous . __eou__ So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? __eou__ Definitely not . __eou__ You see , we still have hurdle .
What do you think of being a secretary ? __eou__ I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You have to type all day .
That woman is a thorough drag ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ She keeps spitting on the ground . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with her .
Do you like our new history teacher ? __eou__ I'm fed up with his endless talking . __eou__ You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . __eou__ I can't see it .
My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! __eou__ So cool ! Can I get a load of it ?
I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . __eou__ You flatter me .
I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox . __eou__ Yeah , I think it will be wonderful .
I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do __eou__ That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 __eou__ But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . __eou__ The advertised rate is based on double occupancy . __eou__ When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . __eou__ Are you quite sure ? __eou__ Yes . Have a look . __eou__ I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . __eou__ Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . __eou__ Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . __eou__ Thank you .
You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut . __eou__ Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends .
Could you do me a favour ? I don ’ t understand this French document . __eou__ Oh , this is over my head . It ’ s too professional .
I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out . __eou__ 70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that .
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ Why ? What are they like ? __eou__ They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ Maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ I can't afford to move right now . __eou__ Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ?
Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much . __eou__ Let ’ s go for a joy ride .
Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up !
I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . __eou__ It ’ s great .
I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ? __eou__ Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment .
Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious . __eou__ Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him .
I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . __eou__ Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders .
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__ I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here .
Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__ Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me .
Jane , what do think about this dinner ? __eou__ Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time .
How do you like the pizza here ? __eou__ Perfect . It really hits the spot .
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can .
Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . __eou__ Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you .
Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . __eou__ OK , boy . I will buy it for you .
I ran into a glass door yesterday . __eou__ What a bone head ! Be careful next time .
It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts .
Wow ! It ’ s packed . __eou__ The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train .
I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . __eou__ I am just casting pearls before swine .
You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . __eou__ I was not born yesterday .
Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . __eou__ I always meet people like him .
You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry .
Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! __eou__ I got the short end of the stick .
I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me . __eou__ She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp !
You are freaking me out . __eou__ You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me !
Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth ! __eou__ I am so sorry about that . It was just a slip of the tongue .
Look at what you have done . All thumbs . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later .
... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? __eou__ Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? __eou__ What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__ Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job !
it's getting cold . __eou__ yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look . __eou__ Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern . __eou__ yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? __eou__ it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this blue sweater ? __eou__ that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? __eou__ yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? __eou__ that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . __eou__ I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . __eou__ perfect ! __eou__ you have good fashion sense , Karen . __eou__ thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . __eou__ yes , but with our sense we'll always look good .
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny .
Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . __eou__ Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__ Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__ That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket !
Car trouble center . How may I help you ? __eou__ My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! __eou__ Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? __eou__ Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . __eou__ Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? __eou__ Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? __eou__ No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . __eou__ So what do you think it is ? __eou__ I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? __eou__ Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank !
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? __eou__ Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . __eou__ Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . __eou__ Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__ What ! I resent that ! __eou__ Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol !
What do you think of this one ? __eou__ Eh , so so . __eou__ And this one ? Too flashy ? __eou__ Nah , not too flashy . __eou__ Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? __eou__ I guess . __eou__ Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . __eou__ And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! __eou__ Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! __eou__ Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! __eou__ And Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Merry Christmas !
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more !
Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! __eou__ I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . __eou__ What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__ Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__ Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ?
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving .
Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept __eou__ yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time .
Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... I'll think about it .
Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ really ? What happened ? __eou__ it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee __eou__ that's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ you know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up .
we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? __eou__ oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . __eou__ Jack ? __eou__ yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? __eou__ I will never go out with him anymore . __eou__ why did you say so ? __eou__ last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! __eou__ oh , really ? __eou__ he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . __eou__ are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? __eou__ it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . __eou__ what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? __eou__ I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . __eou__ maybe he should really something about eating etiquette . __eou__ oh , he really should .
I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . __eou__ Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__ Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__ What were the odds ? __eou__ 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! __eou__ Too bad .
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
Hi , Bob , everything okay ? __eou__ more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . __eou__ oh ? What's that ? __eou__ well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . __eou__ what gift ? __eou__ it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift __eou__ you refused the gift ? That's terrible . __eou__ I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__ perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . __eou__ that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor .
Are you cold ? __eou__ Yes , a little . __eou__ I wonder if we can change the temperature . __eou__ I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning . __eou__ There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? __eou__ I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . __eou__ Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep . __eou__ I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them . __eou__ What did they say about the air conditioning ? __eou__ They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . __eou__ That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? __eou__ You can wear more clothes .
I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! __eou__ Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now !
I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! __eou__ That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake .
What's wrong with him ? __eou__ His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party .
My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . __eou__ The early bird catches the worm .
I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . __eou__ Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse .
I'm so busy . I don't know how will get this done . __eou__ You're not the only one with a lot to do . We are all in the same boat .
This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? __eou__ Actually , my mother made it from scratch .
Wow . Look how polite your son has become . __eou__ Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf .
She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . __eou__ She wears her heart on her sleeve .
You are not being a good sport about this . __eou__ That's because you cheated . __eou__ I never cheat . __eou__ Yes , you do .
He came to work late every day that week . Then on Friday , he didn't show up at all . __eou__ That was the straw that broke the camel's back .
Hurry up , get in . __eou__ I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! __eou__ OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! __eou__ Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! __eou__ Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! __eou__ Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! __eou__ What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__ Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! __eou__ I ’ m going as fast as I can ! __eou__ Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . __eou__ You ’ re such a geek !
OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . __eou__ Your English is fluent . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How do you think of the weather today ? __eou__ I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible .
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . __eou__ Self-service ? __eou__ Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . Are you traveling here ? __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . __eou__ In America , most gas stations are like this . __eou__ Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . __eou__ Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . __eou__ What sign ? __eou__ Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . __eou__ I see .
Hurry up . We're going to be late . __eou__ I am hurrying . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I can't figure out which dress to wear .
Oh , no ! Now I'll be late . __eou__ Can I give you a hand ? __eou__ Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown . __eou__ Sure thing . I've got time .
Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? __eou__ Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . __eou__ You don't have to go right away . __eou__ I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money .
I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . __eou__ Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on ! __eou__ Don't worry . I can give you a lift . __eou__ Thank you . You save me .
Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . __eou__ Oh , dear . __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here . __eou__ Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place .
You're acting weird tonight . __eou__ I'm just in the mood to act goofy . __eou__ What brought this on ? __eou__ I guess I'm glad exams are over .
Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! __eou__ Yes . I love it , too . __eou__ Who was the director ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him .
I've just been a little depressed lately . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ Nothing really . __eou__ Then just keep your chin up .
Bob , what are you thinking about ? __eou__ I'm looking forward to going to America . __eou__ When do you go ? __eou__ Next week .
It's taking you forever to do my hair . __eou__ Give me a minute . __eou__ You should've been done already . __eou__ There you go . __eou__ I don't think that you're done . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ My hair looks hideous . __eou__ What's so bad about it ? __eou__ It doesn't look good at all . __eou__ Sorry about that . __eou__ I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . __eou__ Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ?
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . __eou__ If you would like me to , I could help you with that . __eou__ Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? __eou__ I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . __eou__ Is there a good time for you to help me ? __eou__ If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . __eou__ How about meeting in my office ? __eou__ That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . __eou__ Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise !
What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? __eou__ Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . __eou__ Do we need to book a table in advance ? __eou__ No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . __eou__ What time shall we go ? __eou__ Why not now ? I'm hungry .
What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? __eou__ I enjoyed myself , too . __eou__ Shall I give you a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . __eou__ It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . __eou__ That's great . Let's go !
How did you know ? __eou__ It was a kind of sixth sense . __eou__ Does it happen often ? __eou__ No .
I am not certain , but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job . __eou__ Why are you considering trying for it ? __eou__ I think that I might like it , but I am still thinking about it . __eou__ What is it about this job that appeals to you ? __eou__ I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved . __eou__ Yes , you could be right . There is a lot to consider . __eou__ I am also wondering about the pay . __eou__ Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ? __eou__ I am thinking that might be the case . __eou__ I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind .
Can you do push-ups ? __eou__ Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . __eou__ Really ? I think that's impossible ! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups ? __eou__ Yeah ! __eou__ It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too .
How was my singing ? __eou__ Not bad at all .
Let's go eat . __eou__ 0kay . Dinner's on me .
I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market . __eou__ Easy come , easy go .
Should I ask Sara to the party ? __eou__ I would if I were you .
What do you think of the new mayor ? __eou__ No comment .
When will you be able to come here ? __eou__ I can't come until next week . __eou__ Okay , I'll have everything prepared for you when you get here . __eou__ Thanks , I'll see you around Wednesday then .
Michael Jackson's coming to town . __eou__ I Couldn't care less .
Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you like to play tennis with me ? __eou__ I'd like to . __eou__ Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning . __eou__ OK , will do !
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How about you ?
You hurt Ben's feelings . __eou__ So ?
Hello , Jack here . __eou__ Hello , Jack . It's Mary . What are you doing in your office ? __eou__ I am working . I often work late on Thursdays . I am busy this week . __eou__ Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? No , I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to . I'm going out of the town on business . __eou__ What about Saturday ? __eou__ Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . __eou__ Will you come round next Tuesday ? __eou__ Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . __eou__ What do you say to next Wednesday then ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let's make it next Wednesday . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__ Bye .
Jim , I heard you ’ Ve bought a new computer . __eou__ Yes . Look , it is on my desk . __eou__ Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ? __eou__ Not at all . It ’ s a piece of cake . __eou__ A piece of cake ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it .
Happy birthday , Aims ! __eou__ Thank you , Lisa . __eou__ Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . __eou__ I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__ Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you .
I went bungee jumping yesterday . __eou__ That sounds like fun .
Hi , Mary , long time no see . __eou__ I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . __eou__ Yes , next March . __eou__ Congratulations , I hope everything works out .
Well , it was nice meeting you . __eou__ Yes , I hope we meet again . __eou__ Sure , I'll give you a call . __eou__ Okay .
Give me a call tomorrow . __eou__ Okay .
I'm terribly nervous . __eou__ Calm down !
I'm tired of this job . __eou__ So am I .
My wife gave birth to our first child today . __eou__ Wow ! I'm so happy for you .
My uncle passed away last night . __eou__ My condolences .
I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . __eou__ Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . __eou__ So you can learn a lot from him . __eou__ Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy .
Why do you go fishing so often ? __eou__ It's fun .
Is sailing fun ? __eou__ You bet !
How was your vacation in Paris ? __eou__ It was exciting !
My girlfriend dumped me . __eou__ Well , that's life .
My uncle passed away last night . __eou__ My condolences .
How's your girlfriend ? __eou__ We broke up .
You were right . It's raining again . __eou__ I told you so .
How much do you make a month ? __eou__ Mind your own business .
Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Are you here on business ? __eou__ No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges . __eou__ I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . __eou__ Great , let ’ s go !
Let's go in . __eou__ After you .
Hi . What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I've been pretty busy . __eou__ Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . __eou__ Gotta go . Call me tonight . __eou__ Okay . Check you later .
What happened ? __eou__ It was just a misunderstanding .
Guess what ? __eou__ What ?
Why are you all dressed up ? __eou__ I've got a date .
Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other . __eou__ You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later .
Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? __eou__ It was fun , I tell you . __eou__ Tell me about it , will you ? __eou__ Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! __eou__ Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? __eou__ Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__ You were lucky then . __eou__ Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . __eou__ What did you do after that ? __eou__ We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! __eou__ So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . __eou__ Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
Are you ready ? __eou__ Not yet .
You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? __eou__ In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone . __eou__ You are not going to give it up , are you ? __eou__ No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__ I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__ Yes , but whom to ? __eou__ Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . __eou__ That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__ Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . __eou__ Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .
Hello , Bob , this is Frank . __eou__ I know , we've met . __eou__ I didn't know you knew Frank . __eou__ Yes , we met last year at a conference .
I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , he did the same to me .
Get changed ! __eou__ What for ?
Be quiet , Will you ? __eou__ I'm sorry .
What food do you fancy ? __eou__ I feel like something good to eat . __eou__ How about going to Joe's Restaurant . __eou__ Hey , that sounds a good idea .
Hi , how is it going ? __eou__ Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . __eou__ That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . __eou__ Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway .
Hi , Bob , this is Mary . __eou__ Hello , Mary , where do you work ? __eou__ I work for an Internet company . __eou__ Is the pay good ?
What's wrong , Bob ? __eou__ I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ? __eou__ Of course , I will . __eou__ That's great . I'll pick you up at eight .
Bon voyage ! __eou__ Goodbye .
Let's get together this weekend . __eou__ Sounds good .
Happy Anniversary , honey . __eou__ I thought you had forgotten . __eou__ After the trouble I got into last year , no way . __eou__ Thank you honey , it means a lot to me .
What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__ Come on ! A little labor , much health . __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake .
Did you find what you were looking for ? __eou__ I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . __eou__ Okay , let's both look for it now . __eou__ Okay .
I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__ I trust you ’ re keeping well ? __eou__ I'm doing great , thank you . __eou__ So we can get down to business .
Mike's really angry . __eou__ I wonder Why .
Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . __eou__ Maybe we're walking in circles . __eou__ Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago .
It was great meeting you . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Maybe we can meet again sometime ? __eou__ Of course , but I'll have to go now .
Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other . __eou__ But , Bob , we were so good together . __eou__ I'm sorry but it's for the best . __eou__ I don't understand . We were getting along so well .
Time flies ! __eou__ You're telling me .
Will you be okay when you immigrate to America ? __eou__ Sure , I'm looking forward to it . __eou__ What about your parents ? __eou__ I'll get used to not seeing my parents .
How about going to the cinema tonight ? __eou__ That's great . What's on tonight ? __eou__ I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . __eou__ Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__ Don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__ On the contrary , very exciting .
Nice day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , beautiful weather we're having . __eou__ We can't complain about the weather recently . __eou__ Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . __eou__ I wonder how long this weather can last . __eou__ I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family .
How's business ? __eou__ Couldn't be better .
I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . __eou__ Have you ever been to America ? __eou__ No , but I'd really like to . __eou__ You'd like it .
I've moved . __eou__ Where to ?
Hello , Mary . __eou__ Hello , Brian . __eou__ Here is my friend Bob . __eou__ Hello , Bob .
Have you heard the news ? __eou__ No . What happened ?
Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . __eou__ I am very pleased to meet you . __eou__ Bob is in advertising . __eou__ That sounds an interesting job , Bob .
I just got fired . __eou__ You asked for it .
Can you lend me your car ? __eou__ Nothing ' doing .
I'm happy to see you again . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Okay , I'll give you a ring next week .
You and Bob have finished ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Are you going to be okay ? __eou__ Yes , I'm used to being on my own .
Hey , Mark , long time no see . __eou__ Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? __eou__ Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__ They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__ Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . __eou__ I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__ Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? __eou__ Yeah , it sure would .
Hello Bill , what's new ? __eou__ Bob and Mary are back together . __eou__ I'm glad to hear it . __eou__ Me too , they're such a nice couple .
The boss is mad at you . __eou__ Who cares ?
Tom did me many favors . __eou__ For example ?
Don't be afraid . Give it a try . __eou__ Okay .
Why don't you go out with Jack ? __eou__ He makes me sick .
I'm not a VIP . __eou__ You're too humble .
Paul sends you his regards . __eou__ How nice of him !
Thanks for your help . __eou__ No problem , anytime . __eou__ Let me know if I can do anything for you . __eou__ Okay , thank you .
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . __eou__ I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! __eou__ I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . __eou__ That might be a little too cold for some people . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . __eou__ Yes , that would work out better . __eou__ You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . __eou__ Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . __eou__ Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now !
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? __eou__ That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? __eou__ It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . __eou__ Do you need it for the whole weekend ? __eou__ We will need it for both days . __eou__ We will need to know who will be driving the van . __eou__ The van will be driven by Mary and me . __eou__ It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? __eou__ Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . __eou__ Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening .
Peter and Mary broke up . __eou__ Are you serious ?
The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . __eou__ That's a wonderful choice . __eou__ I have chosen January as the month for this retreat . __eou__ January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . __eou__ Yes , maybe another choice might be better . __eou__ I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . __eou__ Thank you for thinking of that . __eou__ Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . __eou__ That is a good idea . __eou__ I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers .
I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . __eou__ Are you certain that that is what you want to do ? __eou__ It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it . __eou__ Why do you think that this would be a good move ? __eou__ I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . __eou__ Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . __eou__ Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . __eou__ I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better . __eou__ Yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . __eou__ I think you should definitely apply for the position .
It's all over . I'm bankrupt . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will be fine .
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . __eou__ What a great idea ! __eou__ January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . __eou__ I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . __eou__ You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . __eou__ April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . __eou__ That is a good suggestion . __eou__ We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . __eou__ Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . __eou__ I'll put the survey online this afternoon .
I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend . __eou__ Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ? __eou__ It is in the park downtown . __eou__ Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday ? __eou__ We will need it for Saturday only . __eou__ I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ? __eou__ Mary and I will be driving the van . __eou__ Could you drop it off on Sunday night ? __eou__ Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? __eou__ Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night .
Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . __eou__ I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? __eou__ It will be at the beach by the pier . __eou__ What day will you need it for ? __eou__ We will only be needing it for Sunday . __eou__ Maybe that could work . I need to know who will be driving it . __eou__ The only two drivers will be Mary and I . __eou__ If I give you the keys to the garage , could you bring it back on Sunday evening ? __eou__ Sure . We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . Would that be OK ? __eou__ OK , but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest .
You're spending a very long time on my hair . __eou__ I'm almost done . __eou__ I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . __eou__ I'm all done now . __eou__ Are you sure you're finished ? __eou__ I don't understand . __eou__ You did a horrible job on my hair . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ I don't like anything about it . __eou__ I apologize . __eou__ That's fine , but I'm not paying for it . __eou__ Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ?
What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much .
What's taking you so long ? __eou__ Don't worry . I'm almost finished . __eou__ I need you to hurry up . __eou__ All right . I'm finished . __eou__ I think there's more you need to do . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ My hair looks awful . __eou__ What don't you like about it ? __eou__ I just don't like my hair . __eou__ I'm sorry that you don't like it . __eou__ I won't be paying you for this . __eou__ I'm sure we can work something out .
This is great , isn't it ? __eou__ It's the most fun I've had in years . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Yes , we should .
What was that all about ? __eou__ We had a difference of opinion . __eou__ Is she going to be okay ? __eou__ She'll be fine .
What day is it ? __eou__ It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? __eou__ I'm leaving on November 10th . __eou__ Isn't it a Sunday ? __eou__ No , it's a Monday . __eou__ So you are leaving two weeks from now ? __eou__ Right .
What do you think of when you're praying ? __eou__ I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . __eou__ Does that help you faith ? __eou__ Yes .
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . __eou__ I could help you with that . __eou__ Are you sure you have the time ? __eou__ I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . __eou__ What would be the best time for you to help me ? __eou__ Tomorrow night would work for me . __eou__ Should we just meet here ? __eou__ OK , and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . __eou__ I'll see you then . __eou__ See you tomorrow night .
Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! __eou__ Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ? __eou__ I love anything with chocolate the best . __eou__ I like chocolate myself . __eou__ Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? __eou__ I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . __eou__ I haven't ever cared for that myself . __eou__ Have you ever had garlic ice cream ? __eou__ That sounds absolutely disgusting ! __eou__ It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though .
Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__ Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me .
Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? __eou__ I would love to help you prepare for your presentation . __eou__ I hate to ask you to do something like that . __eou__ This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that . __eou__ When could we get together ? __eou__ I could easily give you some time tomorrow night . __eou__ Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? __eou__ Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? __eou__ I'll come prepared . __eou__ Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet .
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! __eou__ Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? __eou__ I love fruit flavored ices the best . __eou__ I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . __eou__ What is your least favorite ice cream ? __eou__ I don't like peppermint ice cream . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . __eou__ One time , I tried garlic ice cream . __eou__ That could be interesting . __eou__ That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order !
I was thinking about applying for the new position . __eou__ Do you think that is a good idea ? __eou__ It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . __eou__ What are your main concerns ? __eou__ Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . __eou__ I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . __eou__ I am also thinking about the pay . __eou__ Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? __eou__ Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . __eou__ I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you .
Is my hair done yet ? __eou__ Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . __eou__ How long until you're finished ? __eou__ I'm finished . What do you think ? __eou__ I like my hair so much . __eou__ Do you really ? __eou__ It's beautiful . __eou__ Well , thank you very much . __eou__ How much is it for my hair ? __eou__ You owe me $ 55 . __eou__ Thanks for everything . __eou__ You are very welcome . Come back again .
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! __eou__ There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? __eou__ Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . __eou__ Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? __eou__ No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? __eou__ I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . __eou__ I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . __eou__ I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . __eou__ I think that would be horrible ! __eou__ I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !
I want to try something different today . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I want a different hair style . __eou__ What style do you want ? __eou__ Can you make my hair short ? __eou__ Exactly how short do you want it ? __eou__ Make it a few inches long . __eou__ Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for a while now . __eou__ Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . __eou__ I honestly want my hair that short . __eou__ All right , then let's begin .
Are you almost finished with my hair ? __eou__ I'm almost finished . __eou__ How much longer is it going to be ? __eou__ I'm done now . Do you like it ? __eou__ I absolutely love it . __eou__ You really like it ? __eou__ Yes , I truly do . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ How much do I owe you ? __eou__ It's going to be $ 55 . __eou__ Here you go , thanks for everything . __eou__ Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks .
Let's do something different today . __eou__ Like how ? __eou__ I would like you to give me a different hair style . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ Give me a short haircut . __eou__ Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? __eou__ I want you to cut it to a few inches long . __eou__ That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? __eou__ I've had this idea for some time now . __eou__ I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . __eou__ This is what I want . __eou__ Fine then . Let's get started .
Will you be done doing my hair soon ? __eou__ Give me a little while longer . __eou__ How much time do you need ? __eou__ There you go . How do you like it ? __eou__ I think it looks gorgeous . __eou__ You think it looks nice ? __eou__ I honestly think it looks great . __eou__ Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job . __eou__ How much is it for my hair ? __eou__ Just give me $ 55 . __eou__ Thanks for doing such a good job . __eou__ No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time .
I really want to switch things up . __eou__ What were you thinking ? __eou__ I think I want to try a new style . __eou__ What would you like me to do ? __eou__ I want you to cut my hair shorter . __eou__ How short ? __eou__ I want my hair to be only a few inches long . __eou__ Do you really want it that short ? __eou__ Yes , I've been wanting it short for a while now . __eou__ If you really want me to , then I'll do it . __eou__ I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want . __eou__ Let's do it .
Excuse me . __eou__ Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet . __eou__ I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long . __eou__ It doesn't matter .
Are you satisfied with the dishes ? __eou__ Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . __eou__ I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . __eou__ Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 __eou__ If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . __eou__ Great , I love hot food too . __eou__ Well , let's finish this great dinner first . __eou__ You said it .
Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . __eou__ Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . __eou__ That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again .
What ? __eou__ What happened with that guy at the cafe ? __eou__ nothing . __eou__ But you ’ re crazy about him . __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? __eou__ I don ’ t actually know him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . __eou__ Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hmm . ' You ’ Ve got mail . '
Do bullfights interest you much ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . __eou__ So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . __eou__ What is it ?
You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . __eou__ So are you . __eou__ And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . __eou__ I feel exactly the same way as you . __eou__ Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . __eou__ What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . __eou__ You don ’ t love me ? __eou__ No . __eou__ But we ’ re so right for each other . __eou__ I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann .
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? __eou__ Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ What ? __eou__ His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things .
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Yeah , those classics from the great writers . __eou__ But I find Japanese ones better .
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal .
How do you feel ? __eou__ I'm nervous as can be .
Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . __eou__ Thanks .
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know .
I'm feeling hungry . __eou__ Isn't it time for dinner ? __eou__ Yes , let's get something to eat . __eou__ How about Mac Donald's ?
The boy threw up . __eou__ That's disgusting .
Shall we go for a drive today ? __eou__ It feels like there's going to be rain later . __eou__ Maybe you're right . __eou__ We'll go tomorrow .
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__ Really ? So what ’ s the news ? __eou__ Not too good yet . Better than I was though .
I'm feeling down . __eou__ Come on . Cheer up !
Where's Bob ? __eou__ It seems like he's not coming . __eou__ Can you give him a call on his mobile ? __eou__ Sure .
I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . __eou__ What's the big deal ?
What day is it today ? __eou__ It's Friday .
I've just had an argument with Bob . __eou__ Really , who started the argument ? __eou__ He did and it's his entire fault . __eou__ Did you know it takes two to tango ?
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I don't have any plans .
You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? __eou__ There are three of them , the Three Tenors . __eou__ Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? __eou__ Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . __eou__ I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . __eou__ Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . __eou__ Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__ Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . __eou__ Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . __eou__ That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . __eou__ Who was the conductor at that event ? __eou__ Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . __eou__ So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . __eou__ The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . __eou__ I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet .
Are you free tonight ? __eou__ I think so .
Did you hear about Bob and Mary ? __eou__ No , what happened ? __eou__ They had an argument and split up . __eou__ Really , what's going to happen now ?
It's getting late . __eou__ Yeah , I'd better head for home .
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . __eou__ I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . __eou__ Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__ They are especially harmful to teenagers . __eou__ But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs .
Dad , what's the date ? __eou__ It's December eighteenth . __eou__ In seven days it will be Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I know that . __eou__ So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? __eou__ Sure , a promise is a promise .
You've met her before , haven't you ? __eou__ I don't recall .
He's too young for the job . __eou__ Give him a chance .
Why do you like this computer ? __eou__ It's user friendly .
David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? __eou__ It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . __eou__ I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! __eou__ Which side are you on ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . __eou__ Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . __eou__ I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . __eou__ What a good goal !
What happened to John ? __eou__ He quit
How old are you ? __eou__ That's a secret .
I don't dare ask Jane for a date . __eou__ You've got no guts !
Why aren't you at work ? __eou__ I called in sick .
We're going dancing tonight . __eou__ Count me out .

See you then . __eou__ See you .
Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . __eou__ Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . __eou__ It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . __eou__ We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? __eou__ About 4 . __eou__ OK . Do you want us to bring something ? __eou__ No , just come here . __eou__ OK , see you later . __eou__ Bye .
Rachel , do you like music ? __eou__ Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . __eou__ What kind of music do you like best ? __eou__ Light music and classic music . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? __eou__ But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . __eou__ I got two . We can go there together . __eou__ Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears .
It's raining . __eou__ Oh , no ! Not again .
I dare you to talk to that girl . __eou__ Okay , I will .
What dances do you like ? __eou__ I love to dance the fast music . __eou__ Then you must be interested in disco . __eou__ Yes , it's my favorite . __eou__ Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance . __eou__ You're a good dancer . __eou__ Thank you . Now they are playing a rumba . Would you have a try ? __eou__ Sorry . I feel like sitting out the next dance . __eou__ OK . Let's get something to drink . __eou__ Good idea .
Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? __eou__ Oh , that scared me . __eou__ The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . __eou__ Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! __eou__ Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? __eou__ Why not ? That's a good idea to help them .
Thanks for everything . __eou__ Don't mention it .
How's business ? __eou__ So so .
Are you free tonight ? __eou__ Depends .
How do you like waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice , I like it very much . __eou__ May I invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer . __eou__ In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . __eou__ Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you like best ? __eou__ Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . __eou__ Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ Fine .

David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! __eou__ You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . __eou__ It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? __eou__ Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award .
I just won the lottery . __eou__ You're kidding !
Why is little Billy crying ? __eou__ He got a scolding .

The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here . __eou__ All information is filled in and now I can design my zone . __eou__ You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . __eou__ Now everything is OK .

I think you dance a lot , right ? __eou__ No . Just occasionally . __eou__ What are your favourite dances ? __eou__ I love rumba and waltz . __eou__ How about samba ? __eou__ To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast . __eou__ Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ? __eou__ OK . See you then . __eou__ See you then .
Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ? __eou__ I have no idea .
Are you tired ? __eou__ Not really .
Shall we sing with a karaoke ? __eou__ Great idea ! I do it every so often . __eou__ For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . __eou__ Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? __eou__ I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . __eou__ I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . __eou__ Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? __eou__ So tricky !
I'll help you with your homework . __eou__ I appreciate that .
I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . __eou__ Yeah , I come here every now and then .
Are you going to take the job ? __eou__ I'll have to sleep on it .
Thanks for the loan . __eou__ Think nothing of it .
B , what's in your hand ? __eou__ Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . __eou__ Why do you read them ? __eou__ As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . __eou__ I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . __eou__ Correct ! What about you , Fred ? __eou__ I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . __eou__ Don't overdo it . __eou__ Shall we have a drink someday ? __eou__ I get drunk easily .
Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ? __eou__ It is free on weekend . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ Here is a guiding plan .
Tom's dating your sister . __eou__ Are you sure ?
Can you give me a ride back home ? __eou__ Sure
Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . __eou__ It is beautiful !

It makes you feel really good . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ Do you mean the red things ? They are roses . __eou__ I'm going to take more pictures today . __eou__ Me , too .
Do you like climbing ? __eou__ Yes , I like it very much . __eou__ How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . __eou__ Have you visited it before ? __eou__ Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . __eou__ Sounds marvelous . __eou__ You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . __eou__ Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing .
David , imagine meeting you here ! __eou__ Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? __eou__ All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . __eou__ It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning . __eou__ How many vegetables do you steal today ? __eou__ I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . __eou__ So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . __eou__ I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . __eou__ I really want to be far away from the reality now . __eou__ But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it .
Awful ! My cell phone is out of service again . Fred , can you lend me some money ? __eou__ How much do you want ? __eou__ 200yuan . I bought a computer online , so I have to pay the mortgage . __eou__ I am so sorry to hear that . Is that enough ? __eou__ It's so nice of you . You really make my day . __eou__ Forget it ! We seemingly need to gather money little by little . __eou__ What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . __eou__ No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it .
We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? __eou__ Don't count on it .
Rob lost his bike . __eou__ What an idiot !
Thanks a million . __eou__ Don't mention it .
Jim was late again . __eou__ It's not like him to be late .
Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie . __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Yes . We can do something else if you like . __eou__ OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect . __eou__ Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ? __eou__ How about 7 o'clock ? __eou__ Good . I will see you then . __eou__ OK . Bye . __eou__ Bye .
Why are you shivering ? __eou__ It's freezing .
I wouldn't dare go bungee jumping . __eou__ Chicken !
Dear Anna . I really love you . __eou__ I love you , too . __eou__ I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? __eou__ Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? __eou__ Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... __eou__ No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . __eou__ Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . __eou__ I trust you . We'll be happy . __eou__ Let me wear you this diamond ring . __eou__ It's so beautiful .
Honey , I've got good news for you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You are going to be a father . __eou__ What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ? __eou__ Yes . We'll have our baby soon . __eou__ Oh , dear , I'm so happy . __eou__ Me , too .
What are you guys doing ? __eou__ Just having a chat .
Wait for me 。 __eou__ Okay . Take your time .

The park is known for them . __eou__ Is there a waterfall ? __eou__ Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon . __eou__ What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? __eou__ You can take No . 2 bus .
How did you do that ? __eou__ It was a piece of cake .
Do you have change for a hundred ? __eou__ Sure .
See you later , alligator . __eou__ In a while , crocodile .
I'm back . __eou__ What have you done ? __eou__ Going shopping . It tires me too much . __eou__ Why don't you go shopping online ? __eou__ Can I ? __eou__ Why not ? Let me recommend a website . __eou__ OK . What does it sell ? __eou__ It sells almost everything you can see in the department . __eou__ That's great .
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again .
Come on in . Make yourself at home . __eou__ Thanks a lot .
Bye . Take care . __eou__ You too .
Who's your favorite singer ? __eou__ Coco Lee .
Where's your better half ? __eou__ She's at home .
We'd better leave now . __eou__ I beg your pardon ?
I just got sacked . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that .
Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) . __eou__ Thanks .
I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . __eou__ What a shame !
Have a nice weekend . __eou__ Same to you .
What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a teacher .
What a coincidence seeing you here . ! __eou__ It is , isn't it ?
How do you like my new sports car ? __eou__ It's cool .
How do you like Korea ? __eou__ I like it . It's a beautiful country . __eou__ What part of the visit excited you most ? __eou__ The best island of Korea-Jizhou island . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming . __eou__ Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Sometimes the traffic is too busy . __eou__ Yes , you are right .
Let's take a coffee break . __eou__ Why not ?
I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? __eou__ Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? __eou__ Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? __eou__ Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? __eou__ No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? __eou__ The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? __eou__ No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself .
I quit my job . __eou__ You can't be serious .
What did you say ? __eou__ Are you deaf or what ?
How's it going ? __eou__ Great !
You can't beat me at tennis . __eou__ Do you want to bet ?
Excuse me . May I come in ? __eou__ Sure . Come on in .
Do you have the time ? __eou__ It's ten thirty .
Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? __eou__ It leaves in 20 minutes . __eou__ Good . __eou__ Can you pick me up from the airport ?
I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight . __eou__ How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? __eou__ Hey , that sounds great . __eou__ Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock .
I'm going to America . __eou__ Any idea when you'll leave ? __eou__ I hope before the end of the month . __eou__ Let me know when you find out .
Is this seat taken ? __eou__ No . Have a seat .
How was your trip to America ? __eou__ We had a fantastic time . __eou__ Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? __eou__ No , but we went to the Kennedy Center .
Where's your hometown ? __eou__ Shandong .
Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? __eou__ Yes , how should I set up my new computer ? __eou__ It's easy , let me help you . __eou__ Great , thanks a lot .
What's today's date ? __eou__ It's January .
What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm feeling a little under the weather .
What would you like to drink ? __eou__ I'll just have water .
Would you like some more rice ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm full .
I'm going shopping . __eou__ Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? __eou__ No . I need to borrow $ 50 . __eou__ Sure , here you go .
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Canada .
Can you imagine having a million dollars ? __eou__ Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . __eou__ Yeah , me too . __eou__ A new car for a start .
When's your birthday ? __eou__ It's just around the corner .
Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? __eou__ Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . __eou__ Okay , that's good . __eou__ Do you want me to put in a good word for you ?
What brings you to Beijing ? __eou__ I'm here on business .
It's awfully hot . __eou__ You can say that again .
Thanks a million . __eou__ My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . )
Why are you laughing ? __eou__ I can't help it .
I'll be seeing you around . __eou__ OK.Take care .
There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? __eou__ Is it formal or informal ? __eou__ I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . __eou__ In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . __eou__ You are right . What about shoes ? __eou__ The brown leather shoes are OK . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it .
I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . __eou__ You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music .
Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ? __eou__ Is it formal or informal ? __eou__ I guess it ’ s formal . __eou__ Then , you should dress well . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you . __eou__ You are smart . __eou__ Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions . __eou__ You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ? __eou__ The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . __eou__ Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? __eou__ It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . __eou__ OK .
What's a good place for sightseeing ? __eou__ Don't ask me .
Freeze ! __eou__ Don't shoot . I give up .
Do you have a light ? __eou__ Sorry , I don't smoke .
Excuse me . Nature calls . __eou__ If you gotta go , you gotta go .
The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . __eou__ They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . __eou__ So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? __eou__ Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . __eou__ Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? __eou__ Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . __eou__ ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? __eou__ Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . __eou__ Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? __eou__ She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . __eou__ Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . __eou__ You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . __eou__ You know , interest is the best teacher . __eou__ So , want me to book the tickets again ? __eou__ Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . __eou__ We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend . __eou__ That will be great .
What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm surfing the Net .
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . __eou__ I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . __eou__ Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? __eou__ Why not ? I'd love to do that . __eou__ Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) __eou__ Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? __eou__ Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? __eou__ I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . __eou__ No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I could never do that . __eou__ Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . __eou__ Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? __eou__ Yes , let's do it . __eou__ Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . __eou__ Of course not . We don't do that .
There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . __eou__ I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? __eou__ ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . __eou__ I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ Those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant .
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over .
How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ What about the party ? __eou__ It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there .
What part did you get in the play this time ? __eou__ I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . __eou__ I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . __eou__ I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . __eou__ I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . __eou__ Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . __eou__ I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while .
What is that you have there ? __eou__ Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this . __eou__ Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone . __eou__ You can't peek ! This is a surprise . __eou__ How about one little hint ? __eou__ Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . __eou__ That's a very good hint . __eou__ And please shut the door and lock it behind you !
Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? __eou__ We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . __eou__ That's it ? That's the tradition ? __eou__ Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . __eou__ I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . __eou__ You should be there some Christmas Eve .
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal .
Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? __eou__ Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . __eou__ How many hours do you work each day now ? __eou__ 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . __eou__ That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? __eou__ I don't care . I need money . __eou__ Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . __eou__ Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . __eou__ But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . __eou__ That's true .
Could you tell me the time ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What time is it , please ? __eou__ It's 9:30 .
Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . __eou__ Thank you , Paul .
Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? __eou__ Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? __eou__ Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . __eou__ Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? __eou__ Yes , that's her . __eou__ I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? __eou__ Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . __eou__ Oh , I am from London as well . __eou__ Where in London do you live ? __eou__ In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . __eou__ I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? __eou__ That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink .
Dad , where are we off to ? __eou__ First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . __eou__ Where are we going to have a drink ? __eou__ There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . __eou__ Good . I will have hot chocolate . __eou__ A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . __eou__ When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . __eou__ Sorry . How far is the museum ? __eou__ I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . __eou__ Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks .
Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . __eou__ When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? __eou__ I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . __eou__ That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? __eou__ Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . __eou__ You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! __eou__ How do you get enough protein in your diet ? __eou__ Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . __eou__ Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? __eou__ I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . __eou__ How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? __eou__ That sounds great . What time should I come over ? __eou__ Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there !
Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! __eou__ Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . __eou__ Who taught you to put on make-up ? __eou__ It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . __eou__ Can you teach me how to do make-up ? __eou__ Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . __eou__ What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? __eou__ I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . __eou__ How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? __eou__ I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . __eou__ How did you grow such long nails ? __eou__ You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time .
Thanks for coming shopping with me . __eou__ I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . __eou__ I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . __eou__ You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . __eou__ Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . __eou__ I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . __eou__ The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? __eou__ These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask .
Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . __eou__ Oh , you're welcome .
What sports do you think women excel at most ? __eou__ I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . __eou__ I mean which ones are they better at than men ? __eou__ Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . __eou__ That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? __eou__ Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . __eou__ Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? __eou__ Are you suggesting that anyone can be ?
What's your favorite season ? __eou__ I like the freedom of summer with no school . __eou__ Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . __eou__ And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . __eou__ Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... __eou__ And I really like the smells and colors of spring . __eou__ I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! __eou__ But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most !
How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? __eou__ I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer !
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn't know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting .
What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . __eou__ This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . __eou__ I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . __eou__ Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! __eou__ Can I read it when you're finished ? __eou__ Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . __eou__ Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . __eou__ Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either .
It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . __eou__ Well , that's life .
I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? __eou__ Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? __eou__ It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years . __eou__ Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ? __eou__ Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II . __eou__ I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for . __eou__ Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world . __eou__ I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games . __eou__ Sure .
My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . __eou__ Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor .
How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ? __eou__ How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read ? __eou__ He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school . __eou__ Does he even know how to speak English ? __eou__ No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . __eou__ That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me . __eou__ Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable ! __eou__ Oh , all right . Have him come over here for dinner . But you get to make dinner !
How annoying ! __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with the program .
As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . __eou__ It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . __eou__ Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . __eou__ For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . __eou__ That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . __eou__ Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . __eou__ But what are the sources of water pollution ? __eou__ They could generally be divided into two categories __eou__ Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . __eou__ But what about the indirect ones ? __eou__ Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . __eou__ I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . __eou__ Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation .
Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! __eou__ You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon .
Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? __eou__ I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! __eou__ Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . __eou__ It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . __eou__ There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? __eou__ When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . __eou__ This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken . I can't wait to use my new hoard . __eou__ It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right .
Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? __eou__ Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . __eou__ Are you from Italy , Christina ? __eou__ No , I am German . I live in Munich . __eou__ Really , I went to Munich last week . __eou__ And did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . __eou__ And where are you from , Jack ? __eou__ I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . __eou__ What are you studying ? __eou__ I am studying languages . This year I am doing German and Italian . __eou__ Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ?
I hate this kind of weather ! __eou__ When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . __eou__ I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . __eou__ He said there are only all kinds of good weather . __eou__ Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ? __eou__ Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . __eou__ We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ? __eou__ I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us .
Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? __eou__ Mind your own business .
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . __eou__ Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . __eou__ Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? __eou__ I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . __eou__ Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . __eou__ I guess that you will really be dressing down . __eou__ That's my style when I'm not in the office . __eou__ Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .
Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . __eou__ I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . __eou__ That explains it .
Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages ! __eou__ Hi George ! It's good to see you ! __eou__ What have you been up to ? __eou__ I just opened up my own business not long ago . __eou__ Good for you ! What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that . __eou__ I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun ! __eou__ Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun !
I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? __eou__ I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? __eou__ Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? __eou__ It's white gold . __eou__ Where did you buy it ? __eou__ My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . __eou__ That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? __eou__ That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . __eou__ You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . __eou__ My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . __eou__ What do you want ? __eou__ I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . __eou__ Why not a ring ? __eou__ I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . __eou__ But you're ready for everything else ? __eou__ Akha .
Do you have any year-end benefits ? __eou__ I don ’ t know till now . __eou__ I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . __eou__ Why they hold a flour war ? __eou__ They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . __eou__ They are not feeling satisfied ? __eou__ It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . __eou__ But how guilty to waste food !
I think I'll write a book . __eou__ What about ? __eou__ All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . __eou__ You have done a lot of traveling . I'll bet you've learned quite a bit . __eou__ The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype . __eou__ Because you can see the results with the general public ? __eou__ That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other . __eou__ I would buy that kind of book !
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . __eou__ That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? __eou__ No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . __eou__ What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? __eou__ Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . __eou__ That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . __eou__ Let's try it !
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going !
Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? __eou__ I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks so much . __eou__ I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . __eou__ I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . __eou__ So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? __eou__ It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . __eou__ I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money .
Guess what I just heard ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ The boss is planning to sell the company . __eou__ You must be joking !
Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? __eou__ No , who won ? __eou__ It's George . __eou__ Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good .
You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! __eou__ Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . __eou__ Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . __eou__ I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . __eou__ You're serious ? __eou__ Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . __eou__ I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . __eou__ Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ?
Hey , Sandy . Do you want to go to the ETV with us ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday .
Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? __eou__ If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . __eou__ He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? __eou__ That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally .
Hey , let's arm wrestle ! __eou__ Not now . __eou__ Chicken ! You're afraid I'll beat you . __eou__ Are you kidding ? I just feel tired right now .
I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . __eou__ Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? __eou__ Yep . And I should start planning now . __eou__ Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? __eou__ Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . __eou__ How Ay days will the reunion be ? __eou__ Usually it's at least five days and four nights . __eou__ This is going to be a major production for you !
Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ? __eou__ Why do I need to do that ? __eou__ My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect . __eou__ Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ? __eou__ My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? __eou__ Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere . __eou__ That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ? __eou__ Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board .
Jack , could you check your calendar ? __eou__ Sure , what's going on ? __eou__ We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . __eou__ Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up .
You really look familiar . __eou__ Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? __eou__ My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? __eou__ Jacob Hammer . He is originally from Holland . __eou__ That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin ! __eou__ It's really a small world , isn't it ! The Hammer family isn't very big . __eou__ It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ? __eou__ I always make time for family .
I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ? __eou__ Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ? __eou__ Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you . __eou__ I'm a little nervous ! __eou__ I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back . __eou__ How Ay people will be there at dinner ? __eou__ Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters . __eou__ That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families .
Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . __eou__ I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? __eou__ Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . __eou__ Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? __eou__ He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . __eou__ He looks like a very personable man . __eou__ He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met .
What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time .
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great .
Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? __eou__ I'm going out this Saturday . __eou__ Do you already have a foursome ? __eou__ Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . __eou__ That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? __eou__ We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . __eou__ How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . __eou__ How much does it cost over there ? __eou__ Twilight rates are 21 dollars . __eou__ That's pretty good . Let's do it . __eou__ Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 __eou__ Make it 4 __eou__ Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time . __eou__ Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then . __eou__ Aright . Have fun on Saturday . __eou__ Will do .
Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? __eou__ Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? __eou__ I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . __eou__ I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . __eou__ Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity .
Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? __eou__ You bet . I'm really excited .
Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I don't know yet . __eou__ I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . __eou__ Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . __eou__ Or what only we are able to give them .
There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ What are the movies that are playing ? __eou__ There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . __eou__ I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . __eou__ So , is that a yes ? __eou__ Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? __eou__ It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . __eou__ Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater !
Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ? __eou__ Hello , there , my name is Tonia . __eou__ Do you sing alto ? __eou__ Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you . __eou__ Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone . __eou__ Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them . __eou__ I heard them warming up earlier . You're right . __eou__ It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone !
It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon . __eou__ That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it .
Hello , this is David . __eou__ Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? __eou__ Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? __eou__ That will work . __eou__ Does five thirty work for you ? __eou__ That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . __eou__ Is it the plans for my new house ? __eou__ Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you .
What stresses you out the most ? __eou__ Probably my parents . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . __eou__ You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . __eou__ Your parents are not like that ? __eou__ Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__ What do you do to deal with the stress ? __eou__ Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . __eou__ That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? __eou__ Sure . Sounds great . Let's go .
It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . __eou__ Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? __eou__ Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . __eou__ Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! __eou__ What other activities will you have tomorrow ? __eou__ Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . __eou__ Do you bring some gifts along ? __eou__ That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . __eou__ Is it the same practice for all families ? __eou__ Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . __eou__ I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . __eou__ Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days .
Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter . __eou__ Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing . __eou__ Where is she right now ? __eou__ She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight . __eou__ Hey , I'll go with you . __eou__ You don't have to . __eou__ It's really no problem . __eou__ Ok . Let's go right after dinner .
There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . __eou__ What kind of food will they be serving ? __eou__ My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . __eou__ It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . __eou__ I can hardly wait ! __eou__ Do you know the day they plan to open ? __eou__ I'll double check the announcement . __eou__ Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ?
Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . __eou__ We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . __eou__ My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . __eou__ What do you think we can see during the festival ? __eou__ I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . __eou__ I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . __eou__ Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . __eou__ Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river .
I have an idea for Christmas this year . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Let's not exchange any gifts at all . __eou__ You big scrooge ! __eou__ Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! __eou__ But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . __eou__ Actual 1y , it was their idea first . __eou__ Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas .
I'll see you in Sterlet , then . __eou__ Where did you say ? __eou__ Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . __eou__ Right .
Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract . __eou__ Sure . I've got a copy here . It's due for renewal at the end of next month . We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy .
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand .
I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday . __eou__ Let's plan a surprise party for him ! __eou__ Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? __eou__ That's easy . Anything else ? __eou__ Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? __eou__ Won't he be surprised ! __eou__ I don't know how old he is though . __eou__ That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans !
Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ? __eou__ Actually , a friend of a friend . __eou__ My name is Phil . What's yours ? __eou__ Alecia . __eou__ Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good . __eou__ Thanks . They look delicious . __eou__ Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some . __eou__ That would be great . I would love some .
We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? __eou__ Okay . But what is a tailgate party ? __eou__ Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! __eou__ How fun ! Can I bring something ? __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . __eou__ I make a mean potato salad ! __eou__ Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! __eou__ Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you !
When do you want to have the open house party ? __eou__ How about next Friday ? __eou__ Friday sounds good . __eou__ How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? __eou__ I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . __eou__ That's what I was thinking . __eou__ I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own . __eou__ Do you feel like a king in your castle ?
I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ? __eou__ It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it ! __eou__ I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid . __eou__ That's exactly why my business is doing so well ! __eou__ How Ay clients do you have already ? __eou__ Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients . __eou__ Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework . __eou__ If you ever need a job , let me know . I can always train you .
Do you like flowers ? __eou__ Of course , I like . __eou__ What's your favorite flower ? __eou__ Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival . __eou__ Spring is a lively season . __eou__ Yes . How about you ? __eou__ I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . __eou__ You have a perfect taste ! __eou__ It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing .
What date is today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? __eou__ I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? __eou__ Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . __eou__ It's not too late . Go to buy some now .
Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . __eou__ So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . __eou__ What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? __eou__ I intend to invite him to dinner .
Hey Jack . How's it going ? __eou__ I'm falling in love . __eou__ What ! With who ? __eou__ That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . __eou__ Did you guys go on a date already ? __eou__ No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . __eou__ Does she have a boyfriend ? __eou__ I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . __eou__ Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . __eou__ I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then . __eou__ So why do you think you're in love ? __eou__ She's the only thing I can think of all day long . __eou__ That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later .
Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? __eou__ My grandmother just passed away . __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? __eou__ A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . __eou__ Is there anything I can do ? __eou__ No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . __eou__ I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? __eou__ Yeah . She died in her sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry she's gone . __eou__ At least she didn't suffer . __eou__ I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . __eou__ I know . But I miss her . __eou__ When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . __eou__ Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . __eou__ It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . __eou__ You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go .
Bill , Happy Halloween ! __eou__ Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? __eou__ I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . __eou__ May I have a look at your costume ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . __eou__ I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . __eou__ I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . __eou__ Haha . Wish you good luck .
Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? __eou__ Jake just broke up with me . __eou__ I'm sorry . When did this happen ? __eou__ Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . __eou__ What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . __eou__ But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . __eou__ He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . __eou__ Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him __eou__ It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . __eou__ I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . __eou__ Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . __eou__ Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . __eou__ How about coffee down the street ? __eou__ Sure .
How do you think about our boss ? __eou__ He's the nicest boss I've had . __eou__ Yes , I think he's the most relaxing person in management . __eou__ What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! __eou__ That's good . Maybe you'll get promoted . __eou__ I hope so .
Merry Christmas , Bill ! __eou__ Merry Christmas . Steven ! __eou__ What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping .

See you later . __eou__ See you .
She is so beautiful , isn't she ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ Julia Roberts . __eou__ Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too . __eou__ It's said that her new movie is going to come out . __eou__ What's the movie about ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about ? __eou__ I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities . __eou__ Yeah , she is great . I also admire her for her concern about society .
Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ? __eou__ I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ? __eou__ I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories . __eou__ I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ? __eou__ I'm fond of history books . __eou__ Oh , the history books are dull to me .
I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . __eou__ Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? __eou__ Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . __eou__ So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? __eou__ Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties .
Jack , what do you think about the election ? __eou__ I think the campaign is a blockbuster . __eou__ How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? __eou__ Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . __eou__ Who do you think will be elected ? __eou__ It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . __eou__ I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . __eou__ Maybe . Who knows ?
Is the lake very polluted ? __eou__ Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . __eou__ Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? __eou__ Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first .
Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . __eou__ Really ? Say it ! __eou__ Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it .
It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband . __eou__ You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ? __eou__ Someone declared that he saw it . __eou__ I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ? __eou__ Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover . __eou__ Maybe !
I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks .

Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? __eou__ I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . __eou__ But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! __eou__ Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . __eou__ But ... But ... __eou__ But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . __eou__ Maybe you are right .
Good afternoon ! __eou__ Hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Wang Lin . I am Mary . __eou__ Is this your first time in Beijing ? __eou__ Yes .

I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . __eou__ Oh , come on .

Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . __eou__ Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . __eou__ But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . __eou__ I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company
What is the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . __eou__ But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . __eou__ Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . __eou__ My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . __eou__ I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . __eou__ Let's go . The time is coming . __eou__ We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema .
Who's that man over there talking to James ? __eou__ Where ? Oh , that's Henry . __eou__ He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? __eou__ He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . __eou__ Really ? I love eccentric people . __eou__ Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . __eou__ Why ? What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Well , haven't you heard ? __eou__ Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . __eou__ Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . __eou__ Really ! How fascinating . __eou__ According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . __eou__ Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . __eou__ Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back .

I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers .

I see . __eou__ How many tickets do you want ? __eou__ Just two . __eou__ OK . Fifty yuan for each . __eou__ Here is the money .
Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ? __eou__ Give them a buzz ? What can I say to them ? Say that you want a loan ? __eou__ I just want to make sure that there is possibility of giving us a loan . __eou__ And they , too , want to make sure their loan is worthwhile .
But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice . __eou__ Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . __eou__ She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . __eou__ Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it .

This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there . __eou__ What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__ Look . It's begin . __eou__ Well , how did you like the show ? __eou__ It's so interesting , I like it very much .
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ The performance is excellent . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Do you have concert halls in your city ? __eou__ Yes , but it's much smaller . __eou__ Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__ OK .
How do you like the play ? __eou__ It is very dull , and the production isn't very satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . __eou__ Maybe you're right . But I really don't like it . __eou__ Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . __eou__ Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . __eou__ Me , too . I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another .
David , do you think we are lucky to have the weekend ? __eou__ Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days . __eou__ I agree with you . What do you want to do , except sleeping ? __eou__ Let me think . Oh , awful !

Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . __eou__ Why do you like it ? __eou__ I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . __eou__ That's wonderful ! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . __eou__ Really ?

Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more .

Honey , would you marry me ? __eou__ I want to think about it for some time . __eou__ Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . __eou__ I know .

Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing planned . How about you ? __eou__ Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . __eou__ I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . __eou__ I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . __eou__ But we have to work tomorrow . __eou__ We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . __eou__ I hear ya . Let's do it .

In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . __eou__ I still think nobody plays for nothing .
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . __eou__ According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . __eou__ But two players of the team have been booked and one is out .
What do you think of the former champ ? __eou__ There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it . __eou__ No champion can remain at the top for ever . __eou__ I suppose he's not in top form .
What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ? __eou__ They aren't evenly matched . __eou__ Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole . __eou__ Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet .
Are you still at that work ? __eou__ Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . __eou__ What sort of job do you have in mind ? __eou__ I think I'm quite fit for a driver . __eou__ But it's very tired . __eou__ I don't care . __eou__ What's your parents ' opinion ? __eou__ I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation .
What do you do now ? __eou__ I'm out of work at the moment . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I was fired last week . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ What's your plan now ? __eou__ After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job . __eou__ Best wishes for you . __eou__ Thank you .
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? __eou__ Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ What ? __eou__ His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it ’ s just one of those things .
Can you tell which team seems to win ? __eou__ Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor . __eou__ Yes . Our guest team is really tough . __eou__ They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see .
We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States . __eou__ Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch .
OK , Hello ! __eou__ Hello ! __eou__ Hi , what's your name ? __eou__ Yeah , my name is Nandu . __eou__ Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ? __eou__ Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U . __eou__ Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Madras .
What's the score ? __eou__ The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . __eou__ The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . __eou__ It doesn't seem to be so easy .
Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? __eou__ No , it's the Japanese team . __eou__ Japanese teams always play a dark horse . __eou__ Well , their team work is well worth learning .
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . __eou__ If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . __eou__ No way , if it still has 21 .
In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? __eou__ Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks . __eou__ Is this your best score ? __eou__ No , once I did 32 .
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive . __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold .
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . What are you up to ? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed . __eou__ That sucks . He must feel depressed . __eou__ Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . __eou__ Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . __eou__ That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . __eou__ Sounds good .
Which team won ? __eou__ The Spur . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ They managed a 99:80 victory .
I'm sure he was off-side . __eou__ But the ref didn't whistle . __eou__ I think he favors the host team . __eou__ Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold .
Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . __eou__ Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? __eou__ Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . __eou__ Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . __eou__ My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . __eou__ You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . __eou__ Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . __eou__ His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . __eou__ And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom .
Which team has won ? __eou__ Neither . The game ended in two all . __eou__ But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . __eou__ But the Brazilian is tougher .
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right .
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . __eou__ What kind of dance do you like ? __eou__ I like rumba and tango . __eou__ Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me . __eou__ You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier . __eou__ OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? __eou__ I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn . __eou__ Sounds pleasant .
Hey Mark . What are you doing ? __eou__ Just watching some TV . __eou__ Anything interesting on ? __eou__ Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . __eou__ So I take it you're pretty bored too . __eou__ Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? __eou__ It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? __eou__ You wanna shoot some hoops ? __eou__ I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . __eou__ Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . __eou__ She's out shopping with her friends . __eou__ Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then . __eou__ Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? __eou__ I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way . __eou__ Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes . __eou__ Aright . See you there .
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him . He's a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__ Exactly .
My friend Jean is very beautiful . __eou__ What's her figure ? __eou__ Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . __eou__ What's the color of her eyes ? __eou__ Dark blue .
What a beautiful day ! __eou__ It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain . __eou__ I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today . __eou__ Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ? __eou__ Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York . __eou__ Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit .
Tony looks very handsome in the suit . __eou__ He prefers suits to jackets . __eou__ Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . __eou__ As a matter of fact , he is .
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . __eou__ There's nothing to watch right now . __eou__ I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored . __eou__ Me too . Let's get together and do something . __eou__ I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . __eou__ Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . __eou__ That's great . We can do something outdoors then . __eou__ Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . __eou__ Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . __eou__ Do you know what time it starts ? __eou__ It starts at one PM . __eou__ Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there . __eou__ Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty .
How are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing great . __eou__ What movies have you seen lately ? __eou__ I saw Forrest Gump the other day . __eou__ What type of movie is that ? __eou__ The movie type is drama . __eou__ I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . __eou__ I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . __eou__ What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? __eou__ I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . __eou__ Out of those what is your favorite ? __eou__ My favorite is to play computer games . __eou__ What is your favorite computer game ? __eou__ My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . __eou__ If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? __eou__ Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week . __eou__ That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? __eou__ I am going to go to the bookstore . __eou__ I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Great . I'll see you on Saturday . __eou__ Ok . See you later .
Steve . Is that you ? __eou__ Yeah . What's going on ? __eou__ Not much . What a surprise to see you here . __eou__ Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . __eou__ What have you been up to ? __eou__ I just started working out . __eou__ Really ? Where do you work out at ? __eou__ I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . __eou__ What do you mostly do during your workout ? __eou__ I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . __eou__ I should start exercising more . __eou__ It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . __eou__ I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . __eou__ Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . __eou__ If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . __eou__ I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . __eou__ Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ Ok . Bye .
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . __eou__ They have moved to Chicago . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job .
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . __eou__ No , thanks all the same . __eou__ Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I really had a good time . __eou__ Well , thank you for coming . __eou__ So see you . __eou__ Bye .
Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China . __eou__ What kind of business do you do ? __eou__ We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties . __eou__ What kind of clients do you prefer ? __eou__ Smaller local companies . We specialize in trade & shipping industry . __eou__ I used to work for a shipping company for six years , and I am quite familiar with some managers . Would your like to meet them ?
Do you like playing table tennis ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ When did you start it ? __eou__ Several years ago .
Who's that tall guy over there ? __eou__ Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . __eou__ What's he like normally ? __eou__ Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . __eou__ Really ? What kind of problems ? __eou__ Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . __eou__ Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . __eou__ Really ? What makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , he doesn't look very honest . __eou__ I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? __eou__ Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? __eou__ Yes , I'll have another cocktail . __eou__ Vodka martini ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ I'll be back in a sec . __eou__ OK . I'll wait here for you .
Who's that striking woman over there ? __eou__ Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? She looks great . __eou__ Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . __eou__ Really ? Tell me more . __eou__ Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . __eou__ Wow , crikey . So what happened ? __eou__ Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . __eou__ Wow . __eou__ Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? __eou__ I have no idea what you're talking about . __eou__ Oh , come on . Everybody knows . __eou__ Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call __eou__ Oh , sure .
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drinks after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of work to do . You need to get her to notice you first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck !
Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I like gardening . __eou__ Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ? __eou__ Yes , follow me . Here it is . __eou__ Your garden is really lovely . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Do you take care of them everyday ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Don't you feel dull ? __eou__ I don't . I like the work .
It is so quiet here . I like the place . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ I can't stand the loud noise in the city . __eou__ Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night . __eou__ I hope I can stay here longer . __eou__ When will your vacation end ? __eou__ The day after tomorrow . __eou__ You will go back tomorrow , right ? __eou__ Yes , you are right .
My eyes water continuously . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps because of the dirty air . __eou__ What is there in the air ? __eou__ Some poisonous gas . __eou__ I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty . __eou__ Yes . I think I won't come here again next time . __eou__ So do I . __eou__ We waste a vacation . __eou__ Maybe you are right .
How are your wedding plans going ? __eou__ Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already . __eou__ Are you going to get married in the church ? __eou__ Neither of us is very religious , so we decided not to get married there . __eou__ Have you booked the hotel for the reception ? __eou__ Yes . The Palace Hotel . You have to be there . __eou__ No problem .
How time flies ! __eou__ Bill and Betty have already grown up . __eou__ I can still remember our first date . __eou__ Look at that big tree over there . __eou__ Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there . __eou__ Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ? __eou__ You seemed to be dull at that time . __eou__ But you agreed to go out with me at last . __eou__ ( Smile ) I can ’ t believe this for it ’ s been 20 years since we got married . __eou__ So do you feel happy now ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t have been any happier ! __eou__ Of course , we are the happiest family in the world .
Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ? __eou__ Take your pick , Julie .
Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . __eou__ Let's go in to wait for them . __eou__ After you .
Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ? __eou__ I am interested in watching TV or other relaxing games . __eou__ How do you spend your spare time ? __eou__ I usually read or entertain myself . __eou__ What kind of books are you interested in ? __eou__ My favorite books are those about detectives . __eou__ Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ? __eou__ When it comes to the entertainment , I think I enjoy dancing . There is nothing I like more than modern dance .
Is that your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ Yes , I guess I should try to use it .
I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ? __eou__ So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . __eou__ What part of the film do you like best ? __eou__ Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . __eou__ I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . __eou__ Actually , tears also came to my eyes . __eou__ It has got this year's Oscar Award . __eou__ It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration .
Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ? __eou__ Yes , Friday I have a class right after work . __eou__ Oh . What about Saturday ? Are you free then ? __eou__ Saturday my parents are coming to town . What's up ? __eou__ What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? __eou__ No . Did you want to go do something ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! I want to take you to dinner . __eou__ Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ?
Are you going out , Jack ? __eou__ I'll be right back . I just need to mail this package .
Hi , Jason ! __eou__ Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ? __eou__ With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ? __eou__ It will be held at the Central Music Hall . __eou__ What is on the program ? __eou__ It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know . __eou__ Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together ! __eou__ Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 . __eou__ See you then .
Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . __eou__ Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__ Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 . __eou__ Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . __eou__ That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever .
Did your wife give birth yet ? __eou__ Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl . __eou__ Congratulations . How is your wife doing ? __eou__ She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now . __eou__ That's good to hear . __eou__ I'm just glad there were no complications . __eou__ If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? __eou__ It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well . __eou__ That's normal for anyone with a newborn . __eou__ Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate . __eou__ You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health . __eou__ That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time .
I've been thinking about getting my hair cut . __eou__ I thought you were going to let it grow out long . __eou__ I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it . __eou__ You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you . __eou__ Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy . __eou__ Have you thought about wearing a hat ? __eou__ Everywhere I go ? __eou__ Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out !
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like playing chess . __eou__ Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__ Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like playing basketball . __eou__ Can you tell me why you like it ? __eou__ Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others .
Which pair of jeans do you like best ? __eou__ I really like the straight legs . __eou__ But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? __eou__ I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . __eou__ That's the style ! You just wear boxers . __eou__ What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? __eou__ You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! __eou__ If you ask me , it's a walking invitation !
We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? __eou__ What is a sixties party ? __eou__ You come dressed in anything from the sixties . __eou__ That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? __eou__ Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . __eou__ Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? __eou__ That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? __eou__ Don't tell me you have a record player !
Look , my clothes are wet . __eou__ Mine are wet , too . __eou__ Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . __eou__ She wished good luck to you . __eou__ The Dai people are enthusiastic . __eou__ Yes .
Did you pass the test ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that .
Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk . __eou__ Oh , I see.Thank you .
Why are those people crying ? __eou__ They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day . __eou__ Tomb Sweeping Day ? What is it ? __eou__ Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead . __eou__ What do they do ? __eou__ People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead .
This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . __eou__ I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often .
I want to buy a gift for my father . Will you go with me to choose one for him ? __eou__ Sure . Is it your father's birthday ? __eou__ Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day . __eou__ Oh ! How could I forget such an important holiday ? __eou__ You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ? __eou__ Yes , let's go .
Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ? __eou__ The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter . __eou__ Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ? __eou__ We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March . __eou__ How do you celebrate it ? __eou__ We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray . __eou__ That sounds interesting .
I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China . __eou__ Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . __eou__ Why are you celebrating this festival ? __eou__ We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan . __eou__ What do you do on that day ? __eou__ We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . __eou__ I see .
Would you like to join the drama club ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Why do you want to join it ? __eou__ It's very exciting . I think .
Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? __eou__ Certainly I do . __eou__ It seems you're very fond of it . __eou__ I'd be happy to do something new .
Would you allow me to drive your car ? __eou__ No problem , but you've got to be careful . __eou__ Surely I will . __eou__ Here's the key then .
My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year . __eou__ What happens on the holiday ? __eou__ Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year . __eou__ Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ? __eou__ Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food .
Hey , May , how are you doing ? __eou__ Oh , I'm a little busy these days . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know Christmas is coming ? I have a lot of things to get ready . __eou__ But you ’ re in China . Are you planning on going home for Christmas ? __eou__ Yeah , so I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave . __eou__ Why not just give them money in red envelopes ?

And I never want to go again . __eou__ I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel now . __eou__ It's only like that the first couple of times . __eou__ Ha . There won't be a next time . __eou__ You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . __eou__ I'll think about it after I start feeling better .

Do you know why ? __eou__ Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? __eou__ He lost his wallet and keys . __eou__ Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story __eou__ So then what happened ? __eou__ Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . __eou__ Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . __eou__ Yes , I know .
What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? __eou__ Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . __eou__ Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it .
You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? __eou__ Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .

That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . __eou__ There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . __eou__ That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . __eou__ Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . __eou__ Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . __eou__ First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' __eou__ Be a yes-man , you mean ? __eou__ You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . __eou__ I hope not .
Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa .
Are you busy next Saturday ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get .

This time it is a country theme . __eou__ That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . __eou__ Well where am I going to get that sort of costume ? __eou__ Leave it to me . I know exactly where to find it . __eou__ Oh good . __eou__ Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need .

Her birthday is next week . __eou__ And when is your son's birthday ? __eou__ That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . __eou__ But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . __eou__ And when is your birthday ? __eou__ Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . __eou__ My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too .
So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ? __eou__ Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now . __eou__ Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? __eou__ Now that's a great plan . It's a date !
I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? __eou__ Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . __eou__ Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . __eou__ Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? __eou__ Sure , more elegant and taller . __eou__ I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . __eou__ If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . __eou__ Thank you .
I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . __eou__ Would you like orchestra seats ? __eou__ Isn't there anything less expensive ? __eou__ Not unless you want the matinee .
What do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? __eou__ The balcony is still available . __eou__ Aren't there any other seats ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid that's it .
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Tina , It's Joe . __eou__ Hi Joe . __eou__ How's the weather there today ? __eou__ It's really cold .

It was even colder this morning . __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . __eou__ Me too . How's the weather where you are ? __eou__ It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow .
Are there any seats left for Saturday night ? __eou__ I still have five seats in the mezzanine . __eou__ I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ? __eou__ No . Nothing . I'm sorry .
Give me Scotch , please . __eou__ What brand ? __eou__ Black Rose . __eou__ Soda or water ? __eou__ Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . __eou__ All right . Please wait for a minute .

Did you do anything fun over the weekend ? __eou__ I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie . __eou__ Why didn't you want to go out ? __eou__ I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater . __eou__ Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ? __eou__ I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it .
Last weekend I didn't want to go out either , so I stayed at home and played video games by myself . It was really fun ! __eou__ Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ... __eou__ Yeah , I'm really into video games . In fact , all my friends are on the Internet . I've never met any of them in the real world . __eou__ Oh really ... well you must be very popular on the Internet . But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home .
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Vicky . __eou__ Are you there yet ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late . __eou__ That's no problem . I just wanted to tell you I'm inside . __eou__ Where are you ? __eou__ On the second floor . __eou__ Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ? __eou__ Come upstairs . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Oh , Can you hear me OK ? I said , come to the second floor . __eou__ Oh , OK . What are you doing there ? __eou__ Just looking at some books on how to learn English . __eou__ Do you want to get something to eat later ? __eou__ No , I'm still full from dinner . __eou__ What do you want to do ? __eou__ I don't know for sure . When you get here we'll talk about it . __eou__ OK , see you soon . __eou__ Bye .
We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ? __eou__ I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion . __eou__ It's my pleasure .

Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Bourbon , please . __eou__ How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ? __eou__ With iced water , please . __eou__ Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water . __eou__ Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? __eou__ The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . __eou__ That is OK .

When do you usually go to the movies ? __eou__ I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? __eou__ The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . __eou__ That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well .
I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ? __eou__ Not really , I like watching horror movies , like ' The Unborn . ' __eou__ You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh . __eou__ I like horror movies because I like to be scared .
Did you like the play ? __eou__ Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous .
Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me .
It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping .

It's Tom861@gmail.com __eou__ OK , I'll talk to you soon . __eou__ OK .
There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . __eou__ I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ? __eou__ Well , why not use buses or the MET ? __eou__ Well , it may not be that simple . Not everyone likes public transport . __eou__ Why not ? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . __eou__ Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know .
Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ? __eou__ The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . __eou__ I see . __eou__ If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me . __eou__ OK , I will .
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . __eou__ Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . __eou__ How about the new bar across road ? __eou__ Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too . __eou__ I agree , I had lunch there last week . __eou__ excellent ! That sounds like a plan .

Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ? __eou__ I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird . __eou__ I know ! I don't get them at all . But wait , isn't ' Terminator ' a sci-fi movie ? __eou__ Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule .
Good morning , you look very tired . __eou__ Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . __eou__ Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? __eou__ No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . __eou__ I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . __eou__ The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . __eou__ Do you have much time watching TV ? __eou__ I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . __eou__ I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . __eou__ If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear .
What did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
Craig , what do you do for work ? __eou__ I'm still a student . __eou__ What school do you go to ? __eou__ Boston University . __eou__ That's a good school . What do you study ? __eou__ I'm studying English , math , and history . My major is English . __eou__ How long have you been studying English ? __eou__ More than six years . __eou__ That's a long time . __eou__ Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school . __eou__ No wonder your English is so good . __eou__ Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice . __eou__ I see . Talking with other people is very important . __eou__ Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet . __eou__ I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come . __eou__ Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come .
Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? __eou__ Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . __eou__ That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? __eou__ You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . __eou__ Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . __eou__ Please go ahead , I am listening . __eou__ I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . __eou__ Is your back door higher than the ground level ? __eou__ Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . __eou__ Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . __eou__ I don't like things to be fancy . __eou__ Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . __eou__ Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? __eou__ Cedar is a good choice . __eou__ Well , let's take the measurements right now .

So beautiful . __eou__ Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . __eou__ Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . __eou__ Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . __eou__ Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? __eou__ Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it .
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ That ’ s a big family .

I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . __eou__ Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . __eou__ Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? __eou__ The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do . __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . __eou__ Great .

How did you meet your girlfriend ? __eou__ I met Amanda through a friend . __eou__ That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? __eou__ We started dating right away .
That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ? __eou__ Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal . __eou__ OK , I'm going to get iTunes and download some Vanilla Ice songs . __eou__ Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy .
How did you first meet ? __eou__ My roommate invited both of us to dinner . __eou__ Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? __eou__ Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love .

It was very exciting . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__ O . K . See you .
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating .
So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? __eou__ Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation .

Good game ? __eou__ Not bad . But too hot for me today . __eou__ Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? __eou__ Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? __eou__ Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . __eou__ Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? __eou__ 16 . Yours ? __eou__ No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . __eou__ Jane . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Me too . So , do you like the course ? __eou__ Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? __eou__ Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . __eou__ Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . __eou__ Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . __eou__ Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? __eou__ Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! __eou__ How awful , poor guy . __eou__ Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . __eou__ Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? __eou__ Yup .
Have you seen this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ They killed another hostage . __eou__ Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__ I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__ Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? __eou__ I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . __eou__ Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? __eou__ Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . __eou__ Oh , sure .
Are you busy with your work ? __eou__ Yes . What about you ? __eou__ Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . __eou__ Then your salary must be high . __eou__ Just so so . But we can travel twice every year . __eou__ Is this time one of them ? __eou__ Yes , we won't travel again until October . __eou__ Really ? We have only one chance every year .
Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ? __eou__ Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? __eou__ How about Legally Blonde . __eou__ Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? __eou__ Isn't that a scary movie ? __eou__ How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun . __eou__ Ok . I'll give it a try . __eou__ That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class . __eou__ Ok . See you tomorrow .
Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? __eou__ Well , I have the day off from work . __eou__ That ’ s great !

Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . __eou__ Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? __eou__ We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll take it . __eou__ Where would you like to sit ? __eou__ Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . __eou__ Certainly .
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . __eou__ Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? __eou__ Thanks .

Take a look . __eou__ Wow , that's really old . __eou__ Yes , I like collecting antiques . __eou__ Why don't you get a new one ? __eou__ I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . __eou__ Really , what makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? __eou__ Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . __eou__ Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? __eou__ Three . Two boys and a girl .
I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . __eou__ Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__ Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__ What were the odds ? __eou__ 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! __eou__ Too bad .
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's not doing too well . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick . __eou__ Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__ That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday . __eou__ Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . __eou__ Thanks . I'll let him know .
It's snowing outside . __eou__ Oh , how could it be ? __eou__ Let's go out and have a look . __eou__ OK . Wait a minute . __eou__ Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . __eou__ Yes . It's really snowing . __eou__ I love winter , I love snow . __eou__ But don't you think it's a little too cold ? __eou__ But I like cold more than hot . __eou__ You are so interesting .
The weather is terrible . __eou__ Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . __eou__ I'm wearing my heavy jacket . __eou__ I'm going to put on more clothes , too . __eou__ Will it snow today ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you like snowing ? __eou__ Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . __eou__ You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . __eou__ Good idea .
Henry , I want to ask you something . __eou__ Say what you want to say . __eou__ You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . __eou__ I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you .

The rainy season will be over soon . __eou__ How long does the rainy season last ? __eou__ About two months . __eou__ I can hardly stand these wet and cold days .

And we will have some pleasant weather then . __eou__ I hope so .

Life's so boring . __eou__ Well , most of the time it is , I guess . __eou__ What do you think will make you happy ? __eou__ I think money will make me happy . __eou__ You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . __eou__ It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . __eou__ You'll get bored eventually . __eou__ Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . __eou__ That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . __eou__ You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities .

Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? __eou__ Do you mean lying to people for their good ? __eou__ Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? __eou__ It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . __eou__ But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . __eou__ I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it .
Have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . __eou__ Which is easier to learn ? __eou__ Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places .
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks .

I think it's about time that we had to go . __eou__ What ? Won't you have more drinks ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . __eou__ Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay . __eou__ Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality . __eou__ Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free .
Happy Thanksgiving ! __eou__ You , too . __eou__ Let's have pumpkin pie . __eou__ It's my favorite .
Happy Valentine's Day ! __eou__ That's nice of you . __eou__ Could I treat you to dinner tonight ? __eou__ Wonderful .
What is your hobby ? __eou__ I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . __eou__ What kind of reading materials do you like best ? __eou__ I am interested in science fiction .
How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? __eou__ In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . __eou__ But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? __eou__ You are deadly right .
Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . __eou__ Why not send them short messages ? __eou__ Can short messages reach them ? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . __eou__ Why haven't I thought of this skill ? __eou__ I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations .
Whose handset sounds so beautiful __eou__ Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? __eou__ Are you able to compose music ? __eou__ No , not yet . __eou__ Who composed it for your ? __eou__ You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . __eou__ Can I get on line to search one , too ? __eou__ Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . __eou__ What about my SIEMENS ? __eou__ Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours .
How do you like this dress ? __eou__ It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? __eou__ Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? __eou__ Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . __eou__ People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . __eou__ Any other common customs of your New Year ? __eou__ Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! __eou__ By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? __eou__ We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . __eou__ Thanks a lot .
It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . __eou__ Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . __eou__ Cool ! What brand __eou__ A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . __eou__ What about the quality ? __eou__ Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear .
I guess I'd better go now . __eou__ I've got to be going now too . __eou__ In that case , I'll be seeing you . __eou__ See you later .
Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ? __eou__ Yes , the snow is often falling thick and fast here . __eou__ Well , I think I like it . I appreciate the snow very much . __eou__ Yes , It's really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow . __eou__ By the way , where can I go ski ? __eou__ There are so many places around . Take a look at the advertisement .
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk .
It's getting late , and I have to go now . __eou__ We're sorry you have to leave . __eou__ Please excuse me , won't you ? __eou__ Certainly . Come back soon .
Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . __eou__ Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope it will be of some use to you . __eou__ I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . __eou__ That will be great .
Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . __eou__ That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it . __eou__ Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? __eou__ Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ? __eou__ No problem . See you ! __eou__ See you !
Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . __eou__ OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ Is it official ? __eou__ It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival .
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? __eou__ Okay ! What do you suggest ? __eou__ How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . __eou__ Is that so ? Why not ? __eou__ ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . __eou__ What's on ? __eou__ Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? __eou__ Ah . The Royal , I think . __eou__ What time does it start ? __eou__ Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . __eou__ But we won't have enough time for dinner . __eou__ Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? __eou__ Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . __eou__ Then , there's a 9:30 show . __eou__ That's Okay , I think . __eou__ All right .
Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you . __eou__ Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf . __eou__ I hope you will like it . __eou__ Of course , I like it very much . Thank you .
What's that , a new video game ? __eou__ Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . __eou__ For instance ? __eou__ It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . __eou__ Wow ! Anything else ? __eou__ This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . __eou__ What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? __eou__ Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go !
When will the ceremony begin ? __eou__ The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? __eou__ No idea . __eou__ As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese .
It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . __eou__ How can I forget my old friend ? __eou__ My best wishes to you and the bride ! __eou__ Thank you very much .
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future .
Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ It's once in blue moon . __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts .
I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert . __eou__ Sure . How do you like your seats ? __eou__ Ordinary one , please . __eou__ Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 . __eou__ I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 . __eou__ That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 .
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . __eou__ Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome .
Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' ! __eou__ What's Net Love ? __eou__ Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . __eou__ Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex ! __eou__ Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ? __eou__ How could you know ? __eou__ I watched the screen display ! __eou__ Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca ! __eou__ It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA ! __eou__ Impossible !
I hear you are moving to Dalian . __eou__ Yes . I found a very good job down here . __eou__ Well , we'll certainly miss you here . __eou__ I am going to miss you , too . __eou__ Let's keep in touch . __eou__ OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there .
I just got a letter from an old high school buddy . __eou__ Really ? That's nice . __eou__ He usually keeps me posted . __eou__ I've been completely out of touch with my old friends . __eou__ It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . __eou__ Yes , people just seem to drift apart .
Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . __eou__ I know that . __eou__ You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . __eou__ Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... __eou__ & you ? __eou__ Look , I am playing the piano for you . __eou__ Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . __eou__ Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . __eou__ OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . __eou__ Ha ! She is too little . __eou__ Cute , like you . __eou__ I want to tell you that I like you __eou__ Me too . Send you a kiss ... __eou__ Thx .
Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? __eou__ I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? __eou__ I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet __eou__ Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ Do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer .
How long have you been living in New York ? __eou__ Oh , about two years now . __eou__ Where do your parents live ? __eou__ They still live in Shanghai where I was born . __eou__ Do you write or call them very much ? __eou__ Yes , I try to keep in touch with them .
Did you enjoy that new movie ? __eou__ That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . __eou__ Oh , what happened , Carole ? __eou__ I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . __eou__ What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . __eou__ Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? __eou__ Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? __eou__ His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . __eou__ I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . __eou__ I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ Doesn't sound promising . __eou__ Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . __eou__ Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class .
It is really exciting news . __eou__ What news ? __eou__ You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__ You know what we will get ? __eou__ We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__ What docking station ? __eou__ This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__ Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough .
Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ? __eou__ No , not yet . Why ? __eou__ For suspicion of driving under influence . __eou__ Oh . I am not his fan .
Hi , Mike , what gives ? __eou__ Hi , Bill , this is my new car . __eou__ Hey , great set of wheels . __eou__ You like it , huh ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . __eou__ It is special , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? __eou__ Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . __eou__ I can imagine . __eou__ Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Ok , let's go .
I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right __eou__ I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . __eou__ Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? __eou__ In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . __eou__ So many ? __eou__ This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . __eou__ Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? __eou__ Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name .
Where do you live now ? __eou__ I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . __eou__ Which street do you live on ? __eou__ I live at No . 50 Xingu Street .

My mother is a housewife . __eou__ Do you live with your family ? __eou__ Yes , we live a happy life together .
Do you have any siblings ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . __eou__ How do you get along with them ? __eou__ We get alone very well .
I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . __eou__ At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . __eou__ Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... __eou__ Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . __eou__ No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . __eou__ No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first .
Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you . __eou__ Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you !
Judy , your husband has a really nice car . __eou__ Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ We're going to visit my sister in the city . __eou__ I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? __eou__ About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . __eou__ I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? __eou__ Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . __eou__ I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . __eou__ Doesn't your mother live in the city ? __eou__ Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . __eou__ I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . __eou__ I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . __eou__ Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . __eou__ See you later .

I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . __eou__ Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . __eou__ Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later .

Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? __eou__ I think so . Why did you ask that ? __eou__ I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? __eou__ It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . __eou__ In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . __eou__ So you will come , won't you ? __eou__ Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . __eou__ Thank you very much .

Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? __eou__ Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? __eou__ I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . __eou__ That will be a good one ! Anything else ? __eou__ Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! __eou__ Sounds great !
Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got back this morning . __eou__ That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? __eou__ Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times .

Do you want to look at them ? __eou__ Sure , I love looking at photos . __eou__ This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . __eou__ Your daughter looks like her mother . __eou__ I know , they look very similar . __eou__ Where was this picture taken ? __eou__ That was taken at the train station before we left . __eou__ Did you have time to go to the zoo ? __eou__ No , not this time . We went there last time . __eou__ It looks like you all had a nice time . __eou__ Yeah , it was a lot of fun .

Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia . __eou__ Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come .
Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? __eou__ Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . __eou__ Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . __eou__ Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . __eou__ I see.Thank you .
Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . __eou__ Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift .

I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses . __eou__ Oh my gosh , how exciting ! __eou__ Will you come with me and help me choose ? __eou__ Sure , I will . How can I miss that ? __eou__ Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror ! __eou__ Oh , don't . I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever !
I think Bill Clinton is a good president . __eou__ But he has the sex scandal . __eou__ Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . __eou__ I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . __eou__ Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . __eou__ yeah , it ’ s fair to say so .
Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? __eou__ Not really ! __eou__ Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . __eou__ Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . __eou__ Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste .
Hey , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? __eou__ About David ? No , I didn ’ t hear anything . __eou__ You know , about David and his new boss . __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . __eou__ Well , I heard David has been fired . __eou__ Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working .
Did you hear Peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young .
I stayed online chatting with friends all night . It was great fun . __eou__ I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to ! __eou__ It is better I don't know them . So I can say anything I want . __eou__ Do you believe what they say ? __eou__ Who cares ? It's just online . It's not real . Do you want to join me tonight ? __eou__ Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist .
Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . __eou__ A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player . __eou__ Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . __eou__ Maybe we all should learn something from him . __eou__ Right .
Have you heard of the Love Bug ? __eou__ Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ? __eou__ Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year . __eou__ This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? __eou__ Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it . __eou__ So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick .
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . __eou__ It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__ Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . __eou__ It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . __eou__ But we need the wood . __eou__ But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood .

Kids will have lot of fun . __eou__ Do you say prayers before dinner ? __eou__ Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment . __eou__ What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving ? __eou__ For me ? The football games of course , I love football games .
Hi . are you new here ? __eou__ Yes . I moved here last week . __eou__ I'm Steven , your neighbour . __eou__ I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on . __eou__ I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then . __eou__ Thank you . I will .
Please come in ! __eou__ Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you . __eou__ Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home . __eou__ OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful . __eou__ Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . __eou__ She must have done a lot of work on it . __eou__ You bet .
Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__ I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . __eou__ Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ? __eou__ It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . __eou__ Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ? __eou__ No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' .
Hi , Mrs . Henderson . __eou__ Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? __eou__ Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? __eou__ The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth .
Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ? __eou__ No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news . __eou__ Indeed , we got married too soon . __eou__ Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ? __eou__ Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time . __eou__ How's your married life ? __eou__ We're happy together now . __eou__ I have to say you're a well-matched couple . __eou__ Thank you !
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years .
Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . __eou__ Thank you . I am very excited . __eou__ We are all very proud of you . __eou__ I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won . __eou__ I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement . __eou__ It was really an exciting moment .
Just make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . __eou__ Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore .
You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . __eou__ No , thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ What about some drink ? __eou__ Please bring me a cup of coffee .
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . __eou__ Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . __eou__ I guess we'll see each other around . __eou__ Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy . __eou__ You too .
I visited the Polar Aquarium today . __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . __eou__ It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . __eou__ Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . __eou__ Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too .
When do children start school in your country ? __eou__ Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . __eou__ But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? __eou__ Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . __eou__ Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? __eou__ It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school .
Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? __eou__ I wouldn't say so . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man .
Look , there are some words on the fish . __eou__ I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . __eou__ For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? __eou__ Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . __eou__ You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . __eou__ Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . __eou__ Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? __eou__ OK , I understand , but what else could we do ?
John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? __eou__ Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? __eou__ Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . __eou__ I'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__ Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . __eou__ Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . __eou__ That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . __eou__ Okay , it sounds good .
May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? __eou__ Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__ Why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__ For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . __eou__ So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? __eou__ No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . __eou__ I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? __eou__ Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . __eou__ Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . __eou__ It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? __eou__ He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? __eou__ He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . __eou__ It must be hard being a father . __eou__ No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . __eou__ Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day .
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team .
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok .
Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here . __eou__ Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze . __eou__ All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? __eou__ Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here .
Happy Birthday , Mary ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? __eou__ I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . __eou__ Really ? It looks so nice . __eou__ Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . __eou__ All right . __eou__ How about some fish ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . __eou__ It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you .
Cheer ! __eou__ So what time tomorrow ? __eou__ Half past seven in the morning . __eou__ Where to meet ? __eou__ In the market . __eou__ OK . Bottoms up . __eou__ Bottoms up . __eou__ It's on me . __eou__ Thank you . This place is nice .
Adam , I'm sorry ! __eou__ But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , you're here . And that's the main thing .
Could you tell me the right time , please ? __eou__ Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . __eou__ You'll have to get it fixed . __eou__ Yes , I will .
What is the correct time , please ? __eou__ It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . __eou__ When will the lecture begin ? __eou__ It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp .
Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . __eou__ In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time . __eou__ Ok . Goodbye . __eou__ See you later .
What time is it , Tom ? __eou__ Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch . __eou__ Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now . __eou__ What's the hurry ? __eou__ I must catch the nine-thirty train . __eou__ You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there .
Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last . __eou__ Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . __eou__ Are you OK today ? __eou__ Quite good except thinking of you so much . __eou__ So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . __eou__ It's called love is blind , I think .
Thank you for coming to see me off . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ If have time , I'll come again . __eou__ You're welcome at any time . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . __eou__ You're most welcome . __eou__ I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . __eou__ Call us as soon as you get home .
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? __eou__ Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . __eou__ What was it about ? __eou__ Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ If so , we may live there someday . __eou__ I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? __eou__ Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . __eou__ Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job .
Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . __eou__ That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . __eou__ Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ The internet's a lot worse . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . __eou__ Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them .
Who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? __eou__ Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ Well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs .
Hmm , what should I wear today ? __eou__ Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . __eou__ Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? __eou__ I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . __eou__ Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . __eou__ No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . __eou__ Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . __eou__ OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first .
How do you like this waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice . I like it very much . __eou__ Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . __eou__ Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I only took up dancing quite recently . __eou__ Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you like best ? __eou__ Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . __eou__ Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure .
I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . __eou__ That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . __eou__ But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . __eou__ You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . __eou__ I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . __eou__ You said it .
You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Why don't you phone her for a date again ? __eou__ I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . __eou__ Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . __eou__ I will . Thanks for your advice .
What are you using for bait today ? __eou__ We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . __eou__ Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . __eou__ Looks like a lucky day for everyone .
Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . __eou__ Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . __eou__ It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . __eou__ I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . __eou__ Then fans don't see you much in public places . __eou__ Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . __eou__ A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' __eou__ I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses .
It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . __eou__ We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . __eou__ He must be all over you the first time he saw you . __eou__ He said that I put all other girls in the shade . __eou__ That means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__ Well , he indeed likes me . __eou__ But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . __eou__ No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel .
I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . __eou__ Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . __eou__ Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . __eou__ I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . __eou__ The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? __eou__ Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . __eou__ Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? __eou__ Why not ?
Herman , why are you so excited ? __eou__ I have met a beautiful girl . __eou__ Have you fallen in love ? __eou__ Yes . At first sight . __eou__ Can you describe the situation at that time ? __eou__ At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . __eou__ What's her outlook ? __eou__ She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden .
Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . __eou__ Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . __eou__ I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . __eou__ Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . __eou__ Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? __eou__ I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map __eou__ Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . __eou__ It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . __eou__ Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide .
Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters .
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that'll affect the national economy . __eou__ That's right.But I don't think there are better ways . __eou__ How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect .
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes , twice .
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good . __eou__ No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters .
I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . __eou__ Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . __eou__ To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . __eou__ Really ?
May I ask what the name is the girl ? __eou__ Which one ? __eou__ The tallest one . __eou__ She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . __eou__ Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ? __eou__ OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . __eou__ How do you think about her ? __eou__ She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl . __eou__ I'm wondering if she has boyfriend . __eou__ No , she hasn't . __eou__ Great ! Thank you very much .
You look a bit dull today . What's up ? __eou__ Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . __eou__ The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . __eou__ Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? __eou__ Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . __eou__ That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . __eou__ Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed .
Can you lend me fifty bucks ? __eou__ What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? __eou__ I guess I don't earn enough . __eou__ No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . __eou__ That's my business , not yours . __eou__ True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . __eou__ So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? __eou__ I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . __eou__ I'm not disciplined enough I guess . __eou__ In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits .
Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . __eou__ You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . __eou__ It sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . __eou__ Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way .
That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? __eou__ Of course . I always keep what I catch . __eou__ Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . __eou__ If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it .
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ What time is the right moment ? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say .
Hey , buddy . Are the fish biting today ? __eou__ They sure are . They are practically jumping in the boat . __eou__ Is that so ? Well , what kind of bait are you using ? __eou__ We're catching most of our fish with lures . __eou__ Lures ? We're using live bait over here . __eou__ What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ? __eou__ We're using worms . __eou__ Are you having any luck with the worms ? __eou__ No , we haven't even gotten a nibble today . __eou__ That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ? __eou__ I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box . __eou__ That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ? __eou__ I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ? __eou__ We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there . __eou__ Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ? __eou__ Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? __eou__ Do you think that's a good spot ? __eou__ Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time . __eou__ Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now . __eou__ Good luck . I hope you each some fish .
What's your favorite hobby ? __eou__ I'd like reading books best . __eou__ What kinds of books do you like to read ? __eou__ Literature and economy . __eou__ By the way , would you like to see movies ? __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . __eou__ I just like to sleep like a lazy cat . __eou__ That's a bad habit .
They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us . __eou__ If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged . __eou__ Of course they are . __eou__ Middle-aged means in the middle , Ethel , middle of life . People don't live to a hundred and fifty . __eou__ Oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . That's all . __eou__ Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging . __eou__ Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? __eou__ I can if you like .
Hello , Mr . Black , I'm calling to say goodbye . __eou__ You're leaving so soon ?

What do you usually do in your work time ? __eou__ Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on . __eou__ Are you usually busy ? __eou__ It depends . Sometimes I am very busy . __eou__ What depends ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can't make sure for my own . __eou__ Oh , I see .
How many persons are there in your family ? __eou__ There are three , my parents and I . __eou__ Do you live together ? __eou__ No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . __eou__ Do you often go back to see your parents . __eou__ Yes , almost once a week .

He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . __eou__ I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' __eou__ That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia .

Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . __eou__ How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . __eou__ Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . __eou__ They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? __eou__ That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . __eou__ Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . __eou__ Have you heard Maria Carey ? __eou__ Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . __eou__ Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . __eou__ I hope you have a good stereo . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . __eou__ I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . __eou__ Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . __eou__ Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__ You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . __eou__ Oh , really ? How does the book end ? __eou__ Read it yourself and find out !
People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . __eou__ And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? __eou__ Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . __eou__ Then what are the Westerners fit for ? __eou__ I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . __eou__ Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? __eou__ It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . __eou__ I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes .
How is night life in Beijing ? __eou__ Very interesting ! __eou__ What do you suggest then ? __eou__ How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . __eou__ That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . __eou__ I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll . __eou__ That's great ! I love to dance to fast music . __eou__ Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well . __eou__ OK . Let's disco . __eou__ Now the band is playing a slow dance . __eou__ That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ? __eou__ Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance . __eou__ All right . Let me get you something to drink .
How do you like this waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice , I like it very much . __eou__ Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . __eou__ Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently . __eou__ Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you do best ? __eou__ Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . __eou__ Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ Fine .
It's rather cold , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . __eou__ Shall I light the stove ? __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ Well , what's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It's mild , but it's not always pleasant . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics .
How nice it is here . __eou__ You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely . __eou__ I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . __eou__ That's correct . We have four seasons of spring .
I'd better be going . __eou__ So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's already late . __eou__ Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . __eou__ Thank you for a wonderful meal . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it .
How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . __eou__ How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . __eou__ I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . __eou__ Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . __eou__ OK . I'll talk to you later .
I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . __eou__ Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . __eou__ I will .
It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . __eou__ Yes , goodbye and keep in touch .
Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . __eou__ Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . __eou__ One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . __eou__ Can you tell me how it is done ? __eou__ If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . __eou__ I see . So great .
What are you doing for Christmas this year ? __eou__ All my relatives are getting together at my house . __eou__ That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too . __eou__ Who can't make it in your family ? __eou__ My sister.She is going to her in-law's house this year . __eou__ That's too bad . So , what did you ask for Christmas this year ? __eou__ I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games . __eou__ I want some computer games also . I gave my parents a really long Christmas list . __eou__ I hope that I get what I asked for . __eou__ So what does your family do on Christmas Day ? __eou__ We wake up early and go to church.Then we come back home and open our gifts together . How about you ? __eou__ Our family is a little different . We go to church on Christmas Eve instead .
Did you get a nice tree ? __eou__ Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ? __eou__ Let's put it over there . __eou__ Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . __eou__ Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations . __eou__ Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches . __eou__ There , ... we're about done . __eou__ Let's switch the lights on . __eou__ OK . Here goes . __eou__ Well , I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas .
We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ? __eou__ Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . __eou__ Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . __eou__ As long as I don ’ t have to row .
These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . __eou__ Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . __eou__ That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . __eou__ I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ? __eou__ I didn't sleep much last night . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up . __eou__ Don't you like games __eou__ I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . __eou__ Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__ Yes .
Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you .

BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . __eou__ Oh , that's great . I want to try later . __eou__ Why not ?
I need your help , Bob . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__ A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__ ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__ Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__ Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__ Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize .
what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . __eou__ you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! __eou__ Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? __eou__ Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . __eou__ Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ Do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? __eou__ No , I prefer to play with people I know . __eou__ How about mah-jong ? __eou__ It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . __eou__ I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? __eou__ No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . __eou__ Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__ They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . __eou__ They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . __eou__ I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . __eou__ Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? __eou__ I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . __eou__ Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__ I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__ People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__ I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__ That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__ Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__ Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
What date is it today ? __eou__ Today is December 23,2002 . __eou__ Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you !
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ How about going to a concert ? __eou__ That suits me fine .
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Oh , nothing . __eou__ What were you writing ? __eou__ ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__ I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__ But , you work with her everyday . __eou__ That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__ Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__ Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ What note ? __eou__ I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ Yeah , I want the note . __eou__ Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ Thanks . I plan on it .

I'll pick you up at 6:00 . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom .
Does your girl friend like swimming ? __eou__ Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style . __eou__ Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke . __eou__ But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke __eou__ Really ? Then just ask her to follow me . __eou__ I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing . __eou__ Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . __eou__ That's good .
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ What should I do then ? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great !
Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . __eou__ That's too bad ! __eou__ Maybe some other time .
Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ? __eou__ Fine , just fine . Thanks . __eou__ Doing anything for lunch ? __eou__ Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas .
T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ? __eou__ Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation .
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance .
How do you like these dishes ? __eou__ Fine , they are colorful and tasty . __eou__ Did you enjoy your dinner ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . __eou__ Would you like some more rice ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm full . __eou__ Another piece of meat pie ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm on diet . __eou__ How about the dessert ? __eou__ Ice cream , please .
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ Thanks ! We love it . __eou__ Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . __eou__ I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !
What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? __eou__ Probably nothing . __eou__ You have to do something romantic . __eou__ Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means . __eou__ Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__ Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone .
What are you doing this Saturday ? __eou__ Not much . __eou__ Do you want to go see a movie ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ What's playing at the Century Fox ? __eou__ Candlelight in the Window __eou__ Should we go see it ? __eou__ I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . __eou__ How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ __eou__ No . I heard that's really boring . __eou__ Why don't we go to a concert instead ? __eou__ Great idea !
Another glass of beer , will you ? __eou__ Thanks , I'm enough . __eou__ At least one for your trip . __eou__ I'll have it if you insist .
Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers .
You keep bowling spares but no strike . __eou__ I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . __eou__ I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . __eou__ Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? __eou__ The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . __eou__ Really ? I will try again .
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__ Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . __eou__ Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . __eou__ Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . __eou__ Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . __eou__ I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .
May I know how old you are ? __eou__ I am 24 . __eou__ What is your date of birth ? __eou__ I was born on April 15 , 1986 .
When and where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing in 1965 . __eou__ You look so young . __eou__ Really ? Thank you .
Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . __eou__ You're really sporty ! __eou__ I want to do everything I can . __eou__ Do you have clubs ? __eou__ No . Can I rent clubs ? __eou__ There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . __eou__ What kinds of clubs ? __eou__ Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . __eou__ I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . __eou__ Okay .
This little wooden stick is called a tee . __eou__ What do you do with it ? __eou__ For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__ Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . __eou__ Got it .
Where is your native place ? __eou__ My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__ So are you a local ? __eou__ Yes , I am a local resident .
I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert . __eou__ How about going to the theatre ? __eou__ I don't like going to the theatre . __eou__ Well , what do you like doing ? __eou__ Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? __eou__ I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . __eou__ I like talking to you , too . __eou__ Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow . __eou__ That's a good idea .
Do you like traveling ? __eou__ Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . __eou__ Where did you visit ? __eou__ I only had time to visit Edinburgh . __eou__ How did you like it ? __eou__ It's fantastic . __eou__ Why did you go there ? __eou__ I went there on business . __eou__ And do you have friends there ? __eou__ Yes , a lot of friends . __eou__ You must have enjoyed yourself . __eou__ Yes , and I look many pictures .
How do you like skiing , Pat ? __eou__ I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . __eou__ I suppose skiing is easy for you . __eou__ No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better . __eou__ I see . Do you ski often ? __eou__ Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? __eou__ Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg __eou__ Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill .
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead .
Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? __eou__ OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? __eou__ Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . __eou__ Are we going to walk or drive ? __eou__ The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . __eou__ The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . __eou__ Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? __eou__ No , he's still sleeping . __eou__ Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night . __eou__ Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM . __eou__ I hope he can come later . __eou__ I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there . __eou__ How do we get to the library from here ? __eou__ It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes .
David , what have you been up to lately ? __eou__ I went on a trip with my family last week . __eou__ Really ? Where did you go ? __eou__ We went to Europe . __eou__ What cities did you go to ? __eou__ London , Paris and a few other cities . __eou__ Did you go to Berlin ? __eou__ No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . __eou__ I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . __eou__ That's what I've heard . __eou__ I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . __eou__ Thanks .
Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . __eou__ I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . __eou__ And do you really love her ? __eou__ I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl .
I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth . __eou__ Oh , never mind . I am just going to do the laundry today . __eou__ I want to apologize . Is there anything can do for you ? __eou__ It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway .
By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? __eou__ Well , it's Thursday today . __eou__ And the date , please . __eou__ The 5th .
It looks like it's going to be sunny . __eou__ Yes , it's much better than yesterday . __eou__ They say we're going to get some rain later . __eou__ Oh , let's just hope it stays warm .
What time do you have ? __eou__ A quarter past five . __eou__ I must be off now . I'm pressed for time . __eou__ See you .
But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . __eou__ I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . __eou__ That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on .
Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . __eou__ Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . __eou__ I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? __eou__ OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye .
Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ? __eou__ I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good . __eou__ Sure , they do . __eou__ But why do you choose cycling at first ? __eou__ Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection . __eou__ You are really a good citizen . __eou__ That ’ s what I can do .
Julia , will you be my wife ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Steven . __eou__ Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you . __eou__ I know . But I ’ m not ready for married life yet . __eou__ Julia , I really love you . I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future . __eou__ Your way does touch my heart . __eou__ So , will you marry me ? __eou__ I want to think of it for some time .
Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? __eou__ Sounds good , when ? __eou__ When is it convenient for you ? __eou__ Any time is fine . __eou__ Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ? __eou__ Please wait for us even if we're a little late . __eou__ Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . __eou__ See you then . __eou__ OK . Bye !
Would you honor us with a visit ? __eou__ I'd love to . Thanks . __eou__ When will you be convenient ? __eou__ Any time will suit me . __eou__ Are you doing anything tomorrow ? __eou__ I'm free tomorrow . __eou__ I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ? __eou__ All right , see you then .
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? __eou__ When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ That's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ When are getting married ? __eou__ Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . __eou__ Congratulations ! I had no idea . __eou__ Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? __eou__ Do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
When will our party be held ? __eou__ Next Wednesday . __eou__ Have you sent out invitations by our party ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ When ? __eou__ Ten days ago . __eou__ Could Dr.Cole like to attend the party ? __eou__ Yes , he will . __eou__ That's fine .
May I have a word with you ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ When will you be free ? __eou__ Come by any time . __eou__ Shall I say around ten o'clock ? __eou__ Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 .
You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? __eou__ I had to look after my son at home . __eou__ What's wrong with him ? __eou__ He has a fever . __eou__ Is he getting better now ? __eou__ I think so.Thank you .
Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China . __eou__ And I must thank you again for your generous help . __eou__ The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ? __eou__ I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards .
Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . __eou__ A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ Do you like him ? __eou__ Yes , I do like him . __eou__ Then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ Maybe you are right .
Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ? __eou__ They're my family __eou__ So you have two brothers ? __eou__ Yes , I'm the third child .
I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? __eou__ Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . __eou__ Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? __eou__ In some way , she is more modern . __eou__ If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . __eou__ If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely .
Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? __eou__ Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . __eou__ Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? __eou__ She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . __eou__ Do you believe her excuse ? __eou__ Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . __eou__ Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend .
Are you working or are you a student ? __eou__ I'm a student . __eou__ Which school are you studying at ? __eou__ Tsinghua University .
Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . __eou__ You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? __eou__ Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . __eou__ Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . __eou__ I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . __eou__ OK , they begin to register . __eou__ It's time I left . __eou__ Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents .
Do you live with your parents ? __eou__ No , they live in Shanghai , my hometown . __eou__ How often do you go back to visit them ? __eou__ Once a year .
May I invite you to dance with me ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't dance . __eou__ Never mind , I can teach you . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ No , it is easy . __eou__ How should I do ? __eou__ You just follow me . __eou__ All right . By the way , do you often dance ? __eou__ Yup , because dance can relax myself . __eou__ It seems a good way .
Hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight ! __eou__ Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory . __eou__ Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ? __eou__ My boss wants me to finish this project tonight .
How will you spend this lovely weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea , any suggestions ? __eou__ We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ? __eou__ It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win . __eou__ OK , settled then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__ See you !
Harry is a hen-pecked husband . __eou__ No , he isn ’ t . __eou__ Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? __eou__ He is afraid of his father-in-law .
I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? __eou__ We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . __eou__ You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . __eou__ Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much .
We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ? __eou__ This Friday evening ? __eou__ Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go . __eou__ Good ! __eou__ What time should I arrive ? __eou__ How about 6:00 ? __eou__ Fine . See you then .
Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? __eou__ Sort of yes . __eou__ But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . __eou__ But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do .
Hello . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ How are you ? __eou__ I'm good . How are you ? __eou__ Good . Do you speak English ? __eou__ A little . Are you American ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from California . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too .
Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? __eou__ I'd like that very much . __eou__ How does 7:30 sound ? __eou__ Fine . See you later .
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? __eou__ I'd enjoy that . __eou__ I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . __eou__ OK . I'll see you then .
Excuse me , what's your name ? __eou__ My name is Jessica . What's yours ? __eou__ John . __eou__ You speak English very well . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Do you know what time it is ? __eou__ Sure . It's 5:10 PM . __eou__ What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's 5:10 PM . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ You're welcome .
Would you like to go to a party tonight ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . __eou__ Would 7:00 be OK ? __eou__ That's fine . I'm looking forward to it .
Hi Sarah , how are you ? __eou__ Fine , how are you doing ? __eou__ OK . __eou__ What do you want to do ? __eou__ I'm hungry . I'd like to eat something . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant . __eou__ What kind of Italian food do you like ? __eou__ I like spaghetti . Do you like spaghetti ? __eou__ No , I don't , but I like pizza .
Do you know that song ? __eou__ Which song ? __eou__ The song you hear now . __eou__ No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? __eou__ Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ? __eou__ No . How about going to karaoke tonight ? __eou__ Good idea .
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me .
Are you OK ? __eou__ Yeah . Why not ? __eou__ Because ... I heard John got married yesterday . __eou__ Oh , you went to the wedding ? __eou__ No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad . __eou__ I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time .
It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . __eou__ That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . __eou__ I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . __eou__ That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles .
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ I don't know . Who ? __eou__ Avril Lavigen ! __eou__ The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__ Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__ So you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too . __eou__ And she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ She looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ Did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs . __eou__ Crazy !
So you are green with envy at your neighbor ? __eou__ Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn . __eou__ But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life . __eou__ I know what you mean . I ’ m not only after bucks . There ’ s something more in life .
Some people are easily flimflammed . __eou__ Maybe they are still wet behind ears . __eou__ They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course . __eou__ Sure . Many people , including men and women , and be easily ripped off .
I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ? __eou__ A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to one . __eou__ Never ? Really ? I'm surprised . __eou__ Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . __eou__ But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here . __eou__ OK , let's go .
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me .
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! __eou__ Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? __eou__ Yes , it is . How do you know that ? __eou__ Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . __eou__ Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? __eou__ I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . __eou__ That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . __eou__ I love this art exhibition ! __eou__ So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? __eou__ OK .

Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . __eou__ I usually play with my schoolmates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . __eou__ Oh , I watched it on television .

It seems to be clearing up . __eou__ It's such a nice change . __eou__ I really don't think this weather will last . __eou__ Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again .
Beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all . __eou__ I wish it would stay this way for the weekend . __eou__ As long as it doesn't snow !

What's the time ? My watch has stopped . __eou__ Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ I think so . I see it by the radio this morning .
David , would you like something to eat ? __eou__ No , I'm full . __eou__ Do you want something to drink ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like some coffee . __eou__ Sorry , I don't have any coffee . __eou__ That's OK .

Can you tell me the time ? __eou__ It's 5:30 by my watch . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month .
What time is it by your watch ? __eou__ I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . __eou__ It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . __eou__ Let's ask someone else .

Is the clock right ? __eou__ I'm afraid it gains a little . __eou__ By how many minutes ? __eou__ Two .
Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It says a storm may come tomorrow . __eou__ Oh ! I hate rainy days ! __eou__ Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . __eou__ What bad luck ! __eou__ Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe you are right !
Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . __eou__ Did it spill on your clothes ? __eou__ No , but the table cloth was dirty . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . __eou__ It's no big deal . __eou__ I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . __eou__ Don't be silly , forget about it .
John , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ? __eou__ Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it . __eou__ I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk . __eou__ Okay , forget about that . S , do you have some practical dreams at present ? __eou__ I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day . __eou__ You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up . __eou__ Thanks , I will .
I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . __eou__ It's nothing to get upset about . __eou__ I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . __eou__ No . It's out of the question .
What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? __eou__ Well , I like playing the violin . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? __eou__ About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . __eou__ That's really interesting . __eou__ Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . __eou__ Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby .
Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm .
I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . __eou__ I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion .
Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? __eou__ Which one will you be going to ? __eou__ We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . __eou__ Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . __eou__ I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . __eou__ OK , can I bring a date with me ? __eou__ Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . __eou__ Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . __eou__ Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . __eou__ I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? __eou__ Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . __eou__ I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . __eou__ One last question.Is there a dress code there ? __eou__ No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . __eou__ Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . __eou__ I'll see you there at 9pm . __eou__ Okay . See you then .
You seem to be very tired . __eou__ Yes , I have been working for eight hours . __eou__ Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? __eou__ No , really . I'm not in the mood for it .
We seem to be lost here . __eou__ Possibly . __eou__ I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman . __eou__ Not a bit .
Steven , why are you so depressed ? __eou__ I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . __eou__ What's the news ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . __eou__ It's horrible . __eou__ Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . __eou__ Yes . How about donating some money ? __eou__ It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? __eou__ Just find the answer through Internet . __eou__ Yes , let's do it now .
Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? __eou__ John , I am just not in the mood for this . __eou__ You look so upset . What's going on ? __eou__ I lost the table tennis game yesterday . __eou__ Oh , what a pity ! __eou__ I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . __eou__ Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . __eou__ My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . __eou__ Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed . __eou__ Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure . __eou__ I understand .
Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . __eou__ You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . __eou__ I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? __eou__ Just take it easy . Come on with me . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you . Shall we find some other time ?
How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? __eou__ Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . __eou__ Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . __eou__ That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . __eou__ You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . __eou__ Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it .
You know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__ Why don't you try to give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . __eou__ Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should have another try .
Charles , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How many children do you have ? __eou__ I have two kids . A boy and a girl . __eou__ What are their names ? __eou__ Jack and Stephanie . __eou__ How old are they ? __eou__ Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . __eou__ Are they in school ? __eou__ Stephanie is .

What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . __eou__ I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . __eou__ It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . __eou__ It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer .
We'd like a half-day package . __eou__ We offer many different sea water treatments . __eou__ How many can we choose ? __eou__ The aquamedic pool is included .

Aha , someone has a crush on Anny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? __eou__ Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ I'd totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance !
Flowers for my favorite girl . __eou__ How did you know that I love red roses ? __eou__ That's a secret . Here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way . __eou__ ( at the dance ) That band is playing good music . Shall we dance ? __eou__ Fine , what do you call this ? __eou__ Foxtrot . Oh . you're a good dancer . __eou__ Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you . __eou__ I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely .
Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do . __eou__ What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ? __eou__ Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final . __eou__ Then , what shall we do on Sunday . __eou__ Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time . __eou__ Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . __eou__ OK .
What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! __eou__ You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? __eou__ From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? __eou__ Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! __eou__ Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . __eou__ He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! __eou__ She's chic , isn't she ? __eou__ Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . __eou__ Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . __eou__ Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! __eou__ The gown is quite expensive , believe me . __eou__ So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . __eou__ You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__ You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . __eou__ Thanks . I'm flattered . __eou__ Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while .
At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! __eou__ Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ Do you know any secrets to China's success ? __eou__ In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money .
Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ? __eou__ All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ? __eou__ I have tickets to a show . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ What kind of music is it ? __eou__ Pop . It's Maria Carey . __eou__ When is it ? __eou__ At 8P M tomorrow night . __eou__ Yeah , I'd like to go . Do you think we should have dinner first ? __eou__ Yes , that's a good idea . __eou__ Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment . __eou__ Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . You have a good memory .
When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ? __eou__ Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister . __eou__ Well ... How about Friday then ? __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__ Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ? __eou__ I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ? __eou__ That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . __eou__ I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday !
Come on , you must tell me everything about him . __eou__ Well , he's very tall and handsome . __eou__ Hmm ... __eou__ He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . __eou__ Oh , how long ? __eou__ Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . __eou__ OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . __eou__ He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He's quite a patient teacher , too . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy .
I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? __eou__ Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! __eou__ I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! __eou__ You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . __eou__ Are you serious , John ? __eou__ All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting .
I finally went out to dinner with him last night . __eou__ Just the two of you ? __eou__ Yup . __eou__ Where did you go ? __eou__ True , a sea food restaurant . __eou__ True ? The food is terrible . __eou__ I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . __eou__ Really ?
I want to say ... __eou__ Say it ! What is it ? __eou__ That I can't go on any longer without you . __eou__ You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . __eou__ Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . __eou__ Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . __eou__ Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . __eou__ Stop it . No more of that talk . __eou__ I really love you . __eou__ No , I shall faint . __eou__ And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . __eou__ Yes .
Are you having a good time ? __eou__ Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . __eou__ Really ? Come on , I'll introduce them to you . __eou__ That would be great .
Hello , Tom ! __eou__ Hello , Steven ! __eou__ How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad .

Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now . __eou__ OK , see you next time . __eou__ See you .
How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? __eou__ Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . __eou__ I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . __eou__ It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . __eou__ Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it . __eou__ If you have any question , you can ask me . __eou__ OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving . __eou__ All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye . __eou__ Bye .
Is this your brother-in-law ? __eou__ Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . __eou__ From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . __eou__ Yes , my sister loves his personality .
What kind of sport do you often do ? __eou__ I go jogging , how about you ? __eou__ I used to swim a lot , but now I'm taking gym classes . __eou__ Oh , that's fantastic !
Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . __eou__ That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . __eou__ Were you one of them ? __eou__ Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her .
Hi ! My name is Mike . __eou__ Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Shanghai . And you ? __eou__ I'm from Chicago .
What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? __eou__ I'm moblogging ! __eou__ Moblogging ? what does that mean ? __eou__ Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . __eou__ Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__ Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . __eou__ What if you want to publish some photos ? __eou__ Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . __eou__ I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . __eou__ You bet it !

It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce .

I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . __eou__ Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . __eou__ What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . __eou__ Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__ That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__ Then , you're probably addicted .

I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__ Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__ Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . __eou__ Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__ Yeah , it's a must .

You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ No , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ Can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__ Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__ I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways .
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .

Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? __eou__ My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future .

What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention .

I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me .

How are you doing , Andrew ? __eou__ Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . __eou__ But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? __eou__ You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . __eou__ What about me ? I ’ m your friend . __eou__ I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . __eou__ I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . __eou__ What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . __eou__ People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . __eou__ That ’ s a possibility . Thanks !
What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? __eou__ My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__ Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . __eou__ That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__ You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
What are you doing now , Steven ? __eou__ I am reading a book about money management . __eou__ Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . __eou__ Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . __eou__ No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . __eou__ Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . __eou__ Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing . __eou__ Thank you for your caring . I will . __eou__ No thanks .
The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ He's always confused by easy questions .

Hi , Craig ! How are you ? __eou__ Not so good . I have a terrible cold . __eou__ Really ? That's too bad ! You should be at home in bed . It's really important to get a lot of rest . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . __eou__ And have you taken anything for it ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__ Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! __eou__ Ugh !
Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . __eou__ I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . __eou__ Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . __eou__ I see . OK .
It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? __eou__ I have found myself a date mate . __eou__ You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . __eou__ A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait .
Do you know who that tall man is ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because everyone is trying to butter him up .
How is he ? __eou__ Not very well . He was white about the gills . __eou__ Did he see the doctor ? __eou__ Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I don't know the reason .
I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? __eou__ Yeah , it happened a week ago . __eou__ That's a crying shame . It really is ! __eou__ Fortunately , she's not seriously injured .

Well , what time does it start ? __eou__ It starts at 8 __eou__ Well , who all is going to be there ? __eou__ Everyone from school . __eou__ How do you know it's going to be so fun ? __eou__ This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . __eou__ Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . __eou__ So am I going to see you at the party ? __eou__ Yeah , I will be there .
Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I didn't have any big plans . __eou__ We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? __eou__ We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . __eou__ Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? __eou__ We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . __eou__ I am assuming that the dress is casual . __eou__ Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! __eou__ Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there .
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I am not sure . What are you doing ? __eou__ I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . __eou__ That sounds like a great idea ! __eou__ Would you be interested in joining me ? __eou__ Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? __eou__ I thought that we could leave around 8 __eou__ That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? __eou__ That was part of my plan . __eou__ Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you .
Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? __eou__ Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . __eou__ That sounds great . Is it casual ? __eou__ Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . __eou__ That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . __eou__ Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . __eou__ That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? __eou__ Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . __eou__ Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .

Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? __eou__ I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK . __eou__ Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine . __eou__ Would you like some help with the food ? __eou__ Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink .

I don't like it in winter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . __eou__ What about the weather in Boston ? __eou__ I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall .

Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . __eou__ Yes , it has been a long time ! __eou__ How long has it been since we last saw each other ? __eou__ I think that we last saw each other two years ago . __eou__ What have you been doing for the past two years ? __eou__ I have been going to graduate school at USC . __eou__ What are you majoring in ? __eou__ I am studying international communications . __eou__ You should easily be able to find a job with that major . __eou__ I am counting on being able to get a good job .

It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right .
Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? __eou__ Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? __eou__ Not bad thanks . __eou__ Good . See you ! __eou__ Bye !
What happened ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Let's stop and have a look . __eou__ Don't waste time . __eou__ I'm curious about that . __eou__ But it's none of our business .
When were you born may I ask ? __eou__ On 20th May 1963 . __eou__ Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? __eou__ 27th day of the fourth month . __eou__ By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? __eou__ It will begin at 5:30 . __eou__ I am afraid I can't be there on time . __eou__ You can see it tomorrow . __eou__ I don't want to miss it today .
I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . __eou__ Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction .
I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad , Where can you park around here ? __eou__ There is a square in front of us . We can park the car there . __eou__ Is a shop there ? __eou__ I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too .
I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . __eou__ He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . __eou__ Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . __eou__ Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days .
How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? __eou__ Oh , I make a phone call once a month . __eou__ It's very expensive , right ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? __eou__ Is it convenient and cheap ? __eou__ Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . __eou__ Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? __eou__ No problem . I'll tell you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it very much .
There is something wrong with my girlfriend . __eou__ What's the trouble ? __eou__ The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . __eou__ What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? __eou__ Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . __eou__ Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ?
I told you that she is no fool . __eou__ I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . __eou__ She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . __eou__ But most bosses are fools for woman .
Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! __eou__ Thanks.Miss Zhang . __eou__ You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much .
Who's singing in your home , Jim ? __eou__ It's Ellie and her friends . __eou__ Who's Ellie ? __eou__ She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " . __eou__ Oh , I see.how old is she ? __eou__ She's ten . __eou__ I suppose they're playing games . __eou__ Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? __eou__ Today . __eou__ Today ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , imagine that !

Happy birthday .
My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You just turn a deaf ear when she talks .
Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? __eou__ Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? __eou__ Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? __eou__ Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . __eou__ Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . __eou__ Ok , see you tonight ! Don ’ t be late !

Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . __eou__ That's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ You know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up .
Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? __eou__ So I hear . __eou__ Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary . __eou__ After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back .
If you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well . __eou__ Come off it . __eou__ You want a bet ? __eou__ Why not ?
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet .
Lisa , I'm home . __eou__ How was your day ? __eou__ Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . __eou__ Anybody I know ? __eou__ Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? __eou__ Of course . You didn't have to ask me . __eou__ That's what Pam said . __eou__ Just don't stay out too late .
Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ? __eou__ I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom . __eou__ Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here . __eou__ But I still have to tell her . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Tell you what , give me your phone number . __eou__ It's 555-4321 . __eou__ Got it .

Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ It was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower . __eou__ Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there . __eou__ What else did you see ? __eou__ Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__ You must have had a great time . __eou__ Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . __eou__ Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . __eou__ That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ You'll have to try for yourself some day .
You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps .

I've invited a lot of friends besides you . __eou__ Should I take my shoes off ? __eou__ We all keep our shoes on indoors . __eou__ Where are your parents ? __eou__ They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . __eou__ That's great !
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . __eou__ Is she American ? __eou__ Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? __eou__ Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__ Thanks !
Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . __eou__ I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments .
Good news ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . __eou__ That ’ s just the short in the arm we need .

See you tomorrow .
I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he is often in trouble . __eou__ She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ Oh , I see .
Hi , Michael , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , things are all right . __eou__ I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? __eou__ Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . __eou__ Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? __eou__ She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " __eou__ Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . __eou__ I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . __eou__ Oh come on , it's not that bad . __eou__ No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . __eou__ Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . __eou__ That's the plan . __eou__ Good luck .
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ Yeah , that's nice . __eou__ Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .
Do you feel better ? __eou__ Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me . __eou__ Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine . __eou__ Thanks a lot . You are so kind .
Did you get the car you wanted ? __eou__ No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . __eou__ What about the car over there ? __eou__ It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well .

What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect .
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ Sign ? What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right .
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice .
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it .
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault .
Well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__ It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . __eou__ Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - __eou__ And the people were so friendly ! __eou__ Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__ Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? __eou__ Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . __eou__ I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . __eou__ If only we could eat there once more ! __eou__ Maybe we can come here again next summer . __eou__ Hope the restaurant is still there . __eou__ Hey , what's the time ? __eou__ Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . __eou__ Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright .
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it .
It's very kind of you to come and see us off . __eou__ My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon ! __eou__ We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . __eou__ You're welcome . Maybe next time we'll come to see you . __eou__ My wife and I will look forward to it . __eou__ I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit . Oh , what's your flight number ? __eou__ lt's Flight No . 302 , Northwest Orient Airlines . __eou__ They just announced the boarding call . __eou__ Then we've got to get going . __eou__ OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing . __eou__ Thank you again for all your help . __eou__ Bye .
Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . __eou__ Well , only you liked it really , darling . __eou__ Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . __eou__ Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . __eou__ I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__ It seems you have to take time .
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly .
Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . __eou__ I know . But I couldn ’ t help .

I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . __eou__ Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . __eou__ I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . __eou__ But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction __eou__ I don't think so .

Jack and Mary broke up . __eou__ It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ Poor Mary !

Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck .
Have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ? __eou__ I am always on the look out for such girls . __eou__ I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . __eou__ Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat .

I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . __eou__ I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . __eou__ Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . __eou__ And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid .
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight .

I learned of the railway accident only this morning . __eou__ A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . __eou__ Is that true ? __eou__ Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . __eou__ Thanks .

What did he say ? __eou__ He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . __eou__ It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . __eou__ Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . __eou__ So the reform cannot be carried out well . __eou__ Government is making efforts to change situation . __eou__ Easier said than done .

Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . __eou__ You are so thoughtful .
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ Yeah . He has no one to count on .
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? __eou__ I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . __eou__ But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . __eou__ I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone .
What will you do now ? Propose to her . __eou__ Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . __eou__ You should strike while the iron is hot . __eou__ You're right . I will have a talk to her about that .

They got a divorce at last . __eou__ It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . __eou__ You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . __eou__ That give us a good lesson .
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point .
What will happen to the children if you break up ? __eou__ That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . __eou__ Why don't you make up with John . __eou__ It's too late .

What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ Was it that crowded ? __eou__ Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ Thank you very much !
Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__ That's fate . __eou__ I feel sorry for her . __eou__ Maybe this is God's will .

You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions .
Bob refused all his classmates ' invitations . __eou__ I really couldn't understand him . __eou__ He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . __eou__ We'd better also leave him alone .

My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race . __eou__ Excuse me , what did you say ? __eou__ A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games . __eou__ That's incredible .

Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam . __eou__ I was the only one who got a strait A in my class . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you .
If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ Why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ Oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us .
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ Maybe it was Dick . __eou__ I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that . __eou__ Then it must be a naughty boy who did it .
I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like fat girls . __eou__ And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? __eou__ I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . __eou__ Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . __eou__ Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . __eou__ But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like a girl to be good .
Nice to see you , Patrick . __eou__ Bob ! I hear your team won the match . __eou__ Yeah . All of us tried our best . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks .
Hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ Great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . __eou__ Do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ You are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ Thank you .
Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to .

I ’ d better not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway .
Jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__ Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__ I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? __eou__ Yes , please . Thank you for everything .
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need .
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ Oh , that sounds great ! __eou__ I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ? __eou__ Yes , that would be perfect . __eou__ See you tonight then . __eou__ Yes . Thank you for inviting me .
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same .
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help .
Are you doing anything tonight ? __eou__ No , nothing . Why ? __eou__ Do you like western music ? __eou__ Yes , I do , very much . __eou__ There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I ’ d love to .
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom .
Hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ Everything's great . And you ? __eou__ Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called " Chinese-Style Divorce " . __eou__ Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ Yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . __eou__ Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ Oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . __eou__ II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage .
Hello , Deva , how are you ? __eou__ Can't complain . What about you ? __eou__ Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ I've heard . She looks quite depressed . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon .
Do you love me ? __eou__ I ’ m very fond of you . __eou__ Yes , but do you love me ? __eou__ Why ? You mean a lot to me . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? __eou__ What question ? __eou__ Do you love me ? Come on , I ’ m eager to hear . __eou__ You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I---I don ’ t feel like saying it
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ? __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
Do you know Sally ? __eou__ Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . __eou__ Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career .
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing .

What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feeling's exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend .
The baby is crying again . __eou__ Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . __eou__ How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . __eou__ OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him .
I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? __eou__ He has been keeping bach after divorce . __eou__ He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . __eou__ Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust .
You are starting to learn English ? __eou__ Yeah . I like it , Dad . __eou__ You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand . __eou__ Really ?
He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . __eou__ Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . __eou__ I don ’ t understand . __eou__ He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him .

Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven .
I cannot stay here any more minutes . __eou__ What is wrong with you ? __eou__ Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . __eou__ You can talk with him .
Hello . Is this Ann ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Kelly ? __eou__ Yes , it's me . __eou__ Do you have a cold ? __eou__ No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . __eou__ Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? __eou__ I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__ I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__ Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__ Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__ Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__ Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__ Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . __eou__ Hope you feel better .
I have some good news for you . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Jenny is getting married . __eou__ Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? __eou__ Tom , that lucky guy . __eou__ The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? __eou__ Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . __eou__ My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? __eou__ July 4 , the National Holiday . __eou__ Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? __eou__ Jenny plans to hold it in church . __eou__ Who is the best man ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ Nobody is OK , but you ! __eou__ You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . __eou__ Did you promise him ? __eou__ Yes , I did .

Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? __eou__ As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . __eou__ Are you feeling better ? __eou__ Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . __eou__ Do you need anything , grocery ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . __eou__ Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? __eou__ I'd like both .
In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ? __eou__ The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . __eou__ Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ? __eou__ They usually do .
Hi , Lucy ! __eou__ Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , It's very great . __eou__ Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ? __eou__ You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc .

So how long have you know Jack ? __eou__ We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . __eou__ Really ? You guys must be really tight . __eou__ Yeah , We're buddy-buddy still . __eou__ He seems sincere , and trustworthy . __eou__ Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people . __eou__ Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that . __eou__ Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying he's like that all the time . __eou__ So , can I trust him or what ? __eou__ Well , I think you should decide for yourself . __eou__ But I need someone that I can count on for this job . __eou__ Okay , Okay.You can trust him . I was just trying to give you a hard time . __eou__ Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight . __eou__ Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone .
Do you feel all right ? You look Pale . __eou__ All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache . __eou__ Have you taken your temperature ? __eou__ No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish . __eou__ How long have you been feeling this way ? __eou__ Only since this morning . __eou__ Oh , probably you've been working too hard . __eou__ Maybe you are right .
Here comes the birthday cake . __eou__ Wow , what a lovely cake . __eou__ Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff . __eou__ Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? __eou__ Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it . __eou__ Better luck this time .

It looks so nice . __eou__ Thank you , Please have a cup of tea . __eou__ All right . __eou__ How about some fish ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ No , just a small one.Next Let's sing " Happy Birthday " to Mary . __eou__ It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you .
How do you like your job here , Linda ? __eou__ It's interesting , I like being an editor . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . __eou__ I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__ I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__ Do you have any complaints ? __eou__ No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? __eou__ Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . __eou__ That's perfect .

Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . __eou__ I'll surely make introductions for them .
Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here .
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . __eou__ Yes . I like it very much . __eou__ Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . __eou__ It's excellent . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . __eou__ It's delicious . __eou__ What sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__ I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? __eou__ I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__ Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . __eou__ It's still early .
May I have your attention please ? __eou__ Would you please be quiet , Ladies and Gentlemen ? __eou__ Well , my speech isn't very long . Would you please ... __eou__ Quiet everybody !
Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . __eou__ But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . __eou__ Thanks for coming . __eou__ How about next time we meet at my place ?

John ’ s dinner partner last month ? __eou__ Yes , I was.You work for 3M , right ? __eou__ I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft.How are things with you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ May I know what you do ? __eou__ I ’ m a fashion designer.Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets.So you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ Sure.That would be great.Good luck . __eou__ Thank you .
Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? __eou__ I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . __eou__ You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! __eou__ Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . __eou__ When did you change your mind ? __eou__ After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . __eou__ I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? __eou__ Yeah . I went to California to study . __eou__ Really ? How long did you stay there ? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90 . __eou__ And what did you do after that ? __eou__ Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience .
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ No , thank you . I can ’ t . __eou__ It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__ Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__ That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . __eou__ ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . __eou__ I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben .
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__ Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . __eou__ Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__ I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__ I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
Billy , you are late again . __eou__ I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__ Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__ You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__ I think he might . You'd better go to his office . __eou__ You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . __eou__ Good luck !
Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . __eou__ Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . __eou__ No problem.Call me when you get back . __eou__ I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? __eou__ That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . __eou__ Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! That's settled then . __eou__ OK .
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__ That's right , I have to work hard .
I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now . __eou__ Out of sight , out of mind . __eou__ Who do you mean ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ?
It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . __eou__ It ’ s a typical of them to do so . __eou__ What can we do ? __eou__ We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it .

I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? __eou__ sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? __eou__ Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about six thirty . __eou__ Got it .

Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one . __eou__ The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog . __eou__ No wonder .

Mary , I heard you moved again . __eou__ Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood . __eou__ You mean noise ? How could it be ? __eou__ You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain .
What is up ? __eou__ Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... __eou__ Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . __eou__ I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me .
Mike promised to help us . __eou__ Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all .
Mary is such a cautious girl ! __eou__ What do you mean by cautious ? __eou__ She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others . __eou__ Thats a clever way to escape responsibility .

I want to try my hand at the stocks . __eou__ It is very hard , you know . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard . __eou__ Good luck !
What did you say when she told you the news ? __eou__ I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . __eou__ But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that . __eou__ How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help .
He is penny wise and pound-foolish . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . __eou__ Maybe all of us are the same .
Who broke the glass , Peter ? __eou__ That cat . __eou__ I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam . __eou__ It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry .
Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . __eou__ It it true of many countries . __eou__ You know why ? __eou__ Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation .
Can you believe that Susan got married ? __eou__ Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? __eou__ No . That ’ s what is surprising me . __eou__ You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . __eou__ He ’ s a postman . __eou__ I thought she would marry a fortune .
In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . __eou__ Who do you think that has the motive ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . __eou__ OK , murder will out ! __eou__ Yeah .
How are you going all these days ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . __eou__ But you look depressed . __eou__ I have some problem with my work . __eou__ Is it serious ? __eou__ I can solve it , thanks . __eou__ How about your family ? __eou__ Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue .
Are you really dating with Frank ? __eou__ Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . __eou__ Then why not keep away from him ? __eou__ The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . __eou__ That ’ s stupid .

The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment . __eou__ It ’ s severe punishment , I think . __eou__ Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood . __eou__ No wonder .
I don ’ t dare to look after the children now . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them . __eou__ It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time .
I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . __eou__ Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . __eou__ But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . __eou__ Then he is really lucky .
Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? __eou__ No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . __eou__ You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . __eou__ Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving .
What happened to your brother ? __eou__ It seems that he has gone ape over the girl . __eou__ Your parents must be worrying about him . __eou__ Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . __eou__ Have you talked to him ? __eou__ Yeah . But he just didn ’ t listen .
I heard you are busy with your new house now ? __eou__ Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one . __eou__ Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house ? __eou__ Yeah .

Mary has really gotten under my skin . __eou__ I know what love it . When I was young , I felt the same way . __eou__ I think I ’ m crazy about her . __eou__ You are , why not ask for a date ?
The government has to face a lot of social problems now . __eou__ I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . __eou__ But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . __eou__ You are right .

Maybe you can do something useful for me . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with you ? __eou__ I ’ ll tell you at the party . __eou__ Okay .
Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet . __eou__ How do you do ?

Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly .
I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? __eou__ It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . __eou__ Who was the conductor ? __eou__ Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . __eou__ Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . __eou__ Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . __eou__ Obviously you did enjoy the concert . __eou__ Yes , I did .
Hi , John . What brings you to town ? __eou__ Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . __eou__ What do you think of the traffic today ? __eou__ It ’ s pretty bad . __eou__ Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . __eou__ I am glad I did not drive a car .
How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? __eou__ Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? __eou__ I like taking photos out of doors . __eou__ Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . __eou__ Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . __eou__ You yourself have a photo studio ? __eou__ Yes , simple as it is .

A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right .
Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? __eou__ Yes , is that you , Allen ? __eou__ Yes , how are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? __eou__ Sure.Thank you very much . __eou__ Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? __eou__ Ok , see you . __eou__ See you .
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that .

It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . __eou__ Do you like the weather in Seattle ? __eou__ Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . __eou__ What about the weather in Boston ? __eou__ I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall .

Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall .
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun .
What would you like to be in the future ? __eou__ A teacher . __eou__ But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . __eou__ I wouldn't like to be a singer , but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing , That dream developed in my mind when I was a child . __eou__ Are you sure about that ? __eou__ I'm quite sure . I've always loved working with children .
Excuse me , how can I fill in this blank ? What does marital status mean ? __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ No , I'm still single . __eou__ Then , you put S in this blank .
Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? __eou__ No , not at all.Go ahead . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ Yes.Is that so important ? __eou__ Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes , I have a three-year-old son .
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right .
Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . __eou__ I'm glad I was able to help . __eou__ It's most kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . __eou__ If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I'm most grateful . __eou__ It was a pleasure .
John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . __eou__ I don't mind at all . __eou__ All right.Are you married ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . __eou__ Then , when do you plan to get married ? __eou__ I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air .
Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? __eou__ To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . __eou__ Do you mean you got a divorce ? __eou__ Yes , my first marriage was a failure .
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect .
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice .
Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ? __eou__ Sorry , they are too busy these days . __eou__ How about this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I think so .
I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? __eou__ Well , actually , I'm not free today . Do you have anything urgent ? __eou__ No , I just want to meet you . __eou__ How about tomorrow instead . __eou__ Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? __eou__ All right . See you then .
I just dropped in to say good-bye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I'm going to try to leave by ten . __eou__ Take care and give my best to your parents . __eou__ Good-bye . Hope to see you soon again next year . __eou__ Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo .
Do you want to go shopping with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? __eou__ How about Saturday morning ? __eou__ Sounds good .
What's the bonus like at your company ? __eou__ Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . __eou__ Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! __eou__ Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . __eou__ Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . __eou__ Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ A new home health monitor . __eou__ Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ No joke ! __eou__ That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them .
How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . __eou__ You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime . __eou__ Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today . __eou__ Today ? __eou__ Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here . __eou__ Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you . __eou__ If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . __eou__ I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home .
Hello , Jill . __eou__ Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? __eou__ Fine , only a little tired . __eou__ You'll recover after a good night's sleep . __eou__ Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence . __eou__ That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__ The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me . __eou__ It's my pleasure . __eou__ I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them . __eou__ Thank you.Thank you for the trouble you've taken . __eou__ Not at all .
Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I passed ! __eou__ Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . __eou__ Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . __eou__ Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it . __eou__ You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You .
Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock . __eou__ What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ... __eou__ I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that . __eou__ I see . Where are you now , Li ? __eou__ Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge . __eou__ It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ? __eou__ I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi ! __eou__ That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock . __eou__ I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting . __eou__ It doesn't matter.Bye . __eou__ Bye .
Why , Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here . __eou__ So what ? Are we going anywhere ? __eou__ Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ? __eou__ What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there . __eou__ I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me .
I really like the book you lent me the other day . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting . __eou__ Oh , I'm glad . __eou__ Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? __eou__ No problem .
You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? __eou__ I'm sorry , It's all my fault . __eou__ You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . __eou__ Sorry , I had no intention . __eou__ It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? __eou__ I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me .
We can't wait any longer ... __eou__ I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... __eou__ You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? __eou__ I can't afford to . __eou__ All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . __eou__ Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . __eou__ Sorry , I'll try to speak louder .
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by us ? __eou__ Well , you always say you're busy . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . __eou__ I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . __eou__ Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . __eou__ You mean I am groaned a few words ? __eou__ Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage .
Jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__ Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__ I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? __eou__ Yes , please . Thank you for everything .
Many happy returns of the day , darling ? __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ And here is your birthday present . __eou__ A gold watch ! __eou__ Do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind .
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need .
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help .
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same .
Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? __eou__ I don ’ t really mind . __eou__ We can go to that new Chinese restaurant . __eou__ I suppose I could . __eou__ Come on , let ’ s try it . __eou__ All right . If you really want to .
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to .
Look ! It ’ s the start of the Olympic Games . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ You want to watch , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games . __eou__ Please yourself .
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__ By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . __eou__ Good , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? __eou__ Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure .
I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening . __eou__ What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? __eou__ Helen is nice but she talks a lot . __eou__ Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film . __eou__ It sure is .
I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . __eou__ Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . __eou__ But I don't even know what to study . __eou__ If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . __eou__ That's what my parents want me to do . __eou__ You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . __eou__ But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . __eou__ Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . __eou__ And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ You're right . Thank you for the advice .
Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? __eou__ nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember . __eou__ Are you sure you cann't remember ? __eou__ I've absolutely certain . __eou__ Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? __eou__ I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . __eou__ Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ Sure ? __eou__ Quite sure .
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent .
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin .
Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . __eou__ Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . __eou__ You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? __eou__ No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . __eou__ Do you ever get lonely living alone ? __eou__ Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely !
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ Umm ... I think so . What's up ? __eou__ I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating .
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? __eou__ I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they're kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__ Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . __eou__ They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight .
Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__ Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__ Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__ Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?
Do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . __eou__ To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ What about your mother ? Did she help you ? __eou__ Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . __eou__ Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . __eou__ No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that .
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__ Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ?
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Do you like sports , Janice ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me .
Hi , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Don . What a surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . __eou__ Have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . __eou__ Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . __eou__ Sure . Join my class next week .
Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! __eou__ Wow ! Sure ! __eou__ I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . __eou__ Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! __eou__ I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . __eou__ I'd love to help if I can . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! __eou__ Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . __eou__ But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? __eou__ Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . __eou__ I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . __eou__ Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? __eou__ I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . __eou__ I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . __eou__ Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . __eou__ Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students .
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? __eou__ I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . __eou__ Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . __eou__ It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? __eou__ You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! __eou__ But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . __eou__ So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? __eou__ It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! __eou__ So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ?
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ Coming as ? __eou__ Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? __eou__ Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ Feed them ? __eou__ Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ And then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ Yes ! How did you guess that ? __eou__ It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ Good Point ! __eou__ But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ?
I heard you are going to move . __eou__ Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . __eou__ What are you worried about ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . __eou__ You can call a mover . __eou__ How much dose that cost ? __eou__ Around 200 RIB for a truck . __eou__ I think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__ It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . __eou__ That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . __eou__ What kind of house is it ? __eou__ It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . __eou__ Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . __eou__ And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__ Great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__ No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__ That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__ Yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__ Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__ Right , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you .
Did you move into your new apartment ? __eou__ Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . __eou__ Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . __eou__ Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . __eou__ I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . __eou__ Is there a supermarket nearby ? __eou__ Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . __eou__ Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . __eou__ That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking .
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true .
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? __eou__ You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told .
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better .
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel .
Have you heard about Anlesen David ? __eou__ No , have they have another fight ? __eou__ No , they got engaged . __eou__ You must be joking.Those two . __eou__ Well , my dear . I didn't believe either.But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning . __eou__ So when did this happen ? __eou__ Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . __eou__ Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ? __eou__ Next june . __eou__ I can hardly believe it .
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . __eou__ I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ Two months ? How did you find out ? __eou__ I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . __eou__ So you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . __eou__ What'd he do ? __eou__ He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe .
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? __eou__ Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many crazy about it __eou__ I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . __eou__ Maybe .
We scored six goals . __eou__ I don't believe it . __eou__ And I score three of them . __eou__ You are not serious ? __eou__ We had extra time of course . __eou__ I can believe that .
Suit wrote me a letter . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . __eou__ It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student . __eou__ But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl .
Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps . __eou__ Well , thanks all the same , Denise . But no I don't think.Sorry , I'm sure you would enjoy it . I'd like to Denise , but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too . __eou__ But I said thursday.The tickets are for thursday evening . __eou__ Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too . __eou__ I see.Oh , well some other time perhaps . __eou__ Yes . some other time perhaps.Thanks again .
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right .
How are you , Sue ? __eou__ Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s your brother ? __eou__ He is fine . __eou__ He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . __eou__ Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed .
Morning , Tom . __eou__ Hi , Mary . __eou__ You seem to be in a hurry . __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . __eou__ Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then . __eou__ Right . I ’ ll see you later . __eou__ See you later .
Nice to see you , Patrick . __eou__ Bob ! I hear your team won the match . __eou__ Yeah . All of us tried our best . __eou__ Congratulations !
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 __eou__ I see .
Good morning , Miss Li . __eou__ Morning , Mike . __eou__ I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . __eou__ I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? __eou__ I feel much better now . __eou__ Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . __eou__ I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? __eou__ I will .
Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . __eou__ Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? __eou__ Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? __eou__ You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . __eou__ Thank you for your concern .
Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . __eou__ But yesterday you said you would rent it . __eou__ I ’ Ve changed my mind . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right .
I can ’ t decide what to do today . __eou__ Well . Let ’ s go swimming . __eou__ Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? __eou__ Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know .
Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? __eou__ No , it ’ s my sister . __eou__ How old is she ? __eou__ She ’ s 18 . __eou__ She is tall ? __eou__ Yes , she is . __eou__ And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? __eou__ Well , just a little thin .
Is this your new teacher ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Is she short ? __eou__ No , she ’ s average . __eou__ What color are her eyes ? __eou__ They ’ re dark gray . __eou__ What color is her hair ? __eou__ It ’ s blond . __eou__ And how old is she ? __eou__ I don ’ t know .
Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? __eou__ Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . __eou__ Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? __eou__ Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? __eou__ What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? __eou__ No , do you want to go and do something ? __eou__ Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . __eou__ Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ?
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it .
What are you grinning about ? __eou__ Stephany said she would go out with me . __eou__ I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . __eou__ That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . __eou__ All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? __eou__ We ’ re going fishing . __eou__ What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__ These girls are different , they are not wimpy .
Did you like the party ? __eou__ Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . __eou__ Why ? What had you expected ? __eou__ I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting .
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think .
How many languages can you speak ? __eou__ I can speak French and German . __eou__ How well can you speak them ? __eou__ I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . __eou__ Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? __eou__ No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .
Can you speak English ? __eou__ Yes I can . I speak it very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child . __eou__ What else can you speak ? __eou__ Well , I know a little Italian .
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__ You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ I drink a lot of wine . __eou__ If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ I often feel so tired . __eou__ You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it .
How do you get paid ? If you don't mind my asking . __eou__ Not cash . But if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . __eou__ And in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ? __eou__ I don't have to worry about rent . I live right here . __eou__ What ? In your cubicle ? __eou__ Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home .
It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . __eou__ No kidding . Time is running out . __eou__ It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . __eou__ Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through . __eou__ Do you think we'll make it ? __eou__ I guess we'll either make it , or we won't .
Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? __eou__ As long as it doesn't take too long . __eou__ My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . __eou__ Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? __eou__ He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . __eou__ So what's the problem ?
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks .
Hello Michael . __eou__ Hello Todd . __eou__ We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? __eou__ Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory .
Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! __eou__ Hello sir . Good to meet you , too . __eou__ Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason . __eou__ Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? __eou__ Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! __eou__ Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? __eou__ The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . __eou__ That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? __eou__ Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . __eou__ So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? __eou__ I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . __eou__ That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive .
OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! __eou__ Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . __eou__ OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? __eou__ Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ Is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ So , so you're British , do you missing them ? __eou__ Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes .
This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city . __eou__ Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . __eou__ That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . __eou__ I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that . __eou__ And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? __eou__ Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . __eou__ Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds .
Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . __eou__ And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... __eou__ Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? __eou__ That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . __eou__ Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now . __eou__ You really should have stayed with us , Dave .
Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? __eou__ I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division .
Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? __eou__ He has no sense . __eou__ If I were him , I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money . __eou__ But Joe won't you .
Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ? __eou__ I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act . __eou__ He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves . __eou__ But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation .
Susan is going to get a divorce . __eou__ How do you know that ? __eou__ She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . __eou__ Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . __eou__ Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . __eou__ That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ Who will sing in the show ? __eou__ A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... __eou__ Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! __eou__ Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . __eou__ Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . __eou__ She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . __eou__ But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! __eou__ Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . __eou__ You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . __eou__ Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? __eou__ Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! __eou__ OK .
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl .
How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? __eou__ At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! __eou__ Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . __eou__ It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . __eou__ Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . __eou__ Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . __eou__ Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? __eou__ No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . __eou__ But you didn't eat anything today . __eou__ Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . __eou__ All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . __eou__ For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . __eou__ No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__ That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . __eou__ Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__ That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children .
Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__ That's fate . __eou__ I feel sorry for her . __eou__ Maybe this is God's will .
How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . __eou__ Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .
Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . __eou__ All right , Sis ! __eou__ Come on , it's cool outside . __eou__ I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . __eou__ Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? __eou__ Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . __eou__ What ? Are you crazy ? __eou__ I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . __eou__ Ew , Danny , gross ! __eou__ By the way , what's your favorite weather ? __eou__ I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . __eou__ Look , is that Tom ?
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No .

Twice .
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry .

What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right .
John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . __eou__ I don't mind at all . __eou__ All right . Are you married ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . __eou__ Then , when do you plan to get married ? __eou__ I don't know . It's still up in the air .
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect .
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it .
Excuse me . Have you got the time ? __eou__ My watch says half past five . __eou__ Does your watch keep good time ? __eou__ Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . __eou__ Thanks a lot .

Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . __eou__ Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . __eou__ Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . __eou__ It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . __eou__ It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? __eou__ Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? __eou__ That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . __eou__ I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . __eou__ Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . __eou__ I love running . Anything else ? __eou__ Please change your clothes first ! __eou__ I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . __eou__ Sorry , but no jeans here . __eou__ Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home .
Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . __eou__ Come on , just a little piece . __eou__ Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . __eou__ That's amazing . __eou__ If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . __eou__ Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . __eou__ I just want to remind you to behave yourself . __eou__ OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again .
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing .
Do you think you'll get the project ? __eou__ It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . __eou__ I see.After all , he's boss's son . __eou__ But anyway , I'll have a try .
What's his job ? __eou__ He used to be a policeman . __eou__ But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . __eou__ Yeah . He's a private eye now .
He has a girlfriend already . __eou__ You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . __eou__ Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . __eou__ I hope I will meet her soon .
John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . __eou__ I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . __eou__ What is your idea ? __eou__ Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear .
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her . __eou__ He's a chicken guy .
I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . __eou__ Don't you know they've already broken up ? __eou__ I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . __eou__ And he's so handsome .
Doesn't she have any friends ? __eou__ If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . __eou__ Such friends are even worse than enemies . __eou__ She'd better keep away from them .
Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . __eou__ I really couldn't understand him . __eou__ He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . __eou__ We'd better leave him alone .
Have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ? __eou__ I am always on the look out for such girls . __eou__ I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . __eou__ Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat .
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom .
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business .
What's so special today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Didn't you notice all the roses ? __eou__ It's July 7th . Chinese Valentine's Day ! __eou__ Oh , God . I just forget it . __eou__ I thought you had trouble with Clive ! __eou__ No . But now he will be in bigger trouble ! What's a boyfriend for ? Forget about Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too . __eou__ Oh , it's Clive . __eou__ Wow ! Good timing . __eou__ Excuse me for a while.Clive asked me out to a movie ! Do you want to join us ? __eou__ Come on . Two is company . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ It's Valentine's Day . Come on . Just go .
Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__ So no more regret now ? __eou__ Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . __eou__ Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . __eou__ I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . __eou__ It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . __eou__ Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . __eou__ Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! __eou__ Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . __eou__ Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . __eou__ A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . __eou__ Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . __eou__ Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! __eou__ Good that he resembled his old , quick self .
Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . __eou__ Oh , my god , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__ Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . __eou__ The pain is killing me . __eou__ I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . __eou__ I thought leather shoes will do just as well . __eou__ Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? __eou__ God ! It's freezing ! __eou__ Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon .
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? __eou__ I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . __eou__ I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? __eou__ I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . __eou__ I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? __eou__ Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? __eou__ Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . __eou__ I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now .
Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . __eou__ Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! __eou__ OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . __eou__ Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . __eou__ Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . __eou__ Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . __eou__ Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . __eou__ Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . __eou__ Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . __eou__ Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . __eou__ Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . __eou__ Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? __eou__ That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy .
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? __eou__ To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . __eou__ The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . __eou__ Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? __eou__ Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . __eou__ Who plays who ? __eou__ Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . __eou__ It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? __eou__ In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . __eou__ I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . __eou__ Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . __eou__ I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . __eou__ Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . __eou__ That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . __eou__ Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? __eou__ You are always so naughty .
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you .
Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . __eou__ I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . __eou__ Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . __eou__ OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? __eou__ As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . __eou__ That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . __eou__ Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? __eou__ Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . __eou__ Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? __eou__ Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly .
Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . __eou__ I've said you will enjoy your life here ! __eou__ I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . __eou__ My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__ Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? __eou__ Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . __eou__ He performs very well . He is so funny ! __eou__ OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! __eou__ OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . __eou__ OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! __eou__ You are welcome ! We are neighbors !
Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . __eou__ Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Please come in . __eou__ Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . __eou__ I really appreciate it . __eou__ Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . __eou__ I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . __eou__ Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . __eou__ Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . __eou__ Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party .
Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . __eou__ Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane . __eou__ No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? __eou__ Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . __eou__ All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . __eou__ Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . __eou__ No , before the In dynasty . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . __eou__ Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea .
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month .
May , is the university a terrible place ? __eou__ Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? __eou__ Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . __eou__ Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . __eou__ How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . __eou__ Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . __eou__ Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? __eou__ Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . __eou__ What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? __eou__ This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . __eou__ I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . __eou__ Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . __eou__ You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . __eou__ Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision .
Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name . __eou__ Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances . __eou__ What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there . __eou__ Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? __eou__ Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? __eou__ They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . __eou__ Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it . __eou__ It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life . __eou__ Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth . __eou__ Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter . __eou__ There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ? __eou__ Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene .
Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . __eou__ That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . __eou__ I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . __eou__ OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . __eou__ Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . __eou__ 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . __eou__ I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . __eou__ I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . __eou__ Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . __eou__ Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs __eou__ Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools .
May , look , what's that in the cage ? __eou__ Don't you know that ? It's panda . __eou__ Of course I know . I just can't see it very well . __eou__ OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ? __eou__ Of course , Bamboo ! __eou__ That's right . __eou__ I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship . __eou__ You sound quite knowledgeable . __eou__ Not really , panda is my favorite animal . __eou__ Actually , it likes milk too . __eou__ Any way , in a word , panda is our friend . __eou__ Do you know other famous animals in the world ? __eou__ Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous . __eou__ That's right . OK , let's move on .
I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it . __eou__ Is it horror movie ? __eou__ Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? __eou__ No way . I will be scared out of my wits . __eou__ Well , What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__ Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . __eou__ In a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies . __eou__ Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__ Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much . __eou__ The Terminal is a movie of this type . __eou__ So we can relax now . __eou__ Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it .
Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty . __eou__ Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic . __eou__ Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie . __eou__ I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . __eou__ Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get . __eou__ That's my favorite . __eou__ You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable ! __eou__ It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . __eou__ Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . __eou__ All in all , it will never lose its appeal . __eou__ Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? __eou__ Sure . Now you are talking .
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . __eou__ And ? __eou__ And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . __eou__ Poor child !
Nice weather , honey ! __eou__ The days are getting longer ! __eou__ May and Daniel often like this kind of weather . __eou__ Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot . __eou__ Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ? __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time . __eou__ And this kind of weather is rare for the season either . __eou__ Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot . __eou__ So we must seize this chance to go the beach . __eou__ Daniel loves the beach very much ! __eou__ He will enjoy himself this weekend .
What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? __eou__ He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . __eou__ Don't believe him . He's liar . __eou__ We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . __eou__ OK .
I heard that Ann had divorced . __eou__ I suspect it's unavoidable . __eou__ Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . __eou__ Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding .
They got a divorce at last . __eou__ It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . __eou__ You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . __eou__ That give us a good lesson .
What will happen to the children if you break up ? __eou__ That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . __eou__ Why don't you make up with John . __eou__ It's too late .
It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . __eou__ Are you sure of that ? __eou__ I am not certain about that . __eou__ They may have some difficulty in doing it .
Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? __eou__ Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep .
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? __eou__ I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . __eou__ But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . __eou__ I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone .
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . __eou__ Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . __eou__ Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread . __eou__ This situation isn't easy to handle .
You know that ? Dan got a divorce . __eou__ Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . __eou__ Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife . __eou__ He deserved it .
What will you do now ? Propose to her . __eou__ Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . __eou__ You should strike while the iron is hot . __eou__ You're right . I will have a talk to her about that .
What did her boss say to you ? __eou__ He asked me to beef up in the work . __eou__ Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . __eou__ Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days .
You look pale recently . __eou__ Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . __eou__ Take good care of yourself . __eou__ Thank you . I will .
You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . __eou__ Just because he gets on well with everybody ? __eou__ Partly , and he's also a hard working man .
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? __eou__ I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . __eou__ Where did you spend your holiday ? __eou__ I went to Paris .
To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! __eou__ He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . __eou__ Galileo is one of them . __eou__ So are Copernicus and many others .
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? __eou__ I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . __eou__ If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you .
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . __eou__ Because it was her husband who beat her . __eou__ It is incredible . __eou__ She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest .
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so .

Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . __eou__ Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . __eou__ I'll bet you were a little embarrassed . __eou__ You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock . __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don't worry . We won't be the first .
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that's nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I'd forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come .
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage .
Which church do you attend ? __eou__ I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . __eou__ What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? __eou__ Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . __eou__ Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? __eou__ That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . __eou__ Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Why do you really go to church ? __eou__ We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church .
Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . __eou__ But he seems to be very happy with Rose . __eou__ He is more nice than wise .
Where are you going ? __eou__ I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . __eou__ What's wrong with her . __eou__ She is expecting . __eou__ Congratulations to you . __eou__ Thank you .
A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . __eou__ That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . __eou__ He must be regretting about having done the business . __eou__ I bet he is . He domed his own life .
Is this watch yours ? __eou__ No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? __eou__ Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . __eou__ Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place .
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns .
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ Yeah . He has no one to count on .
You look pale , you must have poor health . __eou__ Yeah . You said it . __eou__ Why not go to see the doctor ? __eou__ I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking .
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him .
Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ? __eou__ I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . __eou__ But I cannot forget him .
Where is Tom ? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . __eou__ What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat . __eou__ Oh , I see .
What did he say ? __eou__ He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . __eou__ It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . __eou__ Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . __eou__ So the reform can not be carried out well . __eou__ The government is making efforts to change situation . __eou__ Easier said than done .
Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? __eou__ No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . __eou__ You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . __eou__ I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . __eou__ So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet .
Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? __eou__ I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . __eou__ How do you find the prices there ? __eou__ I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . __eou__ I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? __eou__ Only 2 dollars and 25 cents .
What's the date today Mr.Brown ? I don't have a calendar . __eou__ Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . __eou__ 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . __eou__ What time is your appointment ? __eou__ It is at 8 o'clock . __eou__ What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? __eou__ I don't know what time it is . __eou__ It must be about 6 o'clock . __eou__ I have to go now . I don't want to be late . __eou__ You won't be late . It's still early .
Do I need a visa ? __eou__ No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . __eou__ Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . __eou__ Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__ You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__ Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too .
That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__ Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__ Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . __eou__ I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? __eou__ Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__ All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ?
There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty .
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it .
I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while .
What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? __eou__ I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . __eou__ I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . __eou__ In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? __eou__ Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . __eou__ Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . __eou__ Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ?
What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap .
What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . __eou__ Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors .
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job .
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . __eou__ That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss .
which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there .
Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! __eou__ Hi , Alex ! __eou__ Where have you been ? __eou__ I just got back from London . __eou__ How was your flight ? __eou__ It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? __eou__ It was 10 hours . __eou__ Did you have a layover ? __eou__ Yes , in Paris , France . __eou__ Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? __eou__ Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__ It was nothing .
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok .
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ How would you do that ? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . __eou__ That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it .
What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? __eou__ I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . __eou__ Who ’ s your favourite player ? __eou__ I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . __eou__ Do they have a good team ? __eou__ I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__ I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__ I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . __eou__ You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . __eou__ How many more games are there this season ? __eou__ We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them .
I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” .
Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . __eou__ There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . __eou__ I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . __eou__ Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__ When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__ Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . __eou__ How do I do that ? __eou__ Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . __eou__ That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . __eou__ Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . __eou__ Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? __eou__ This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! __eou__ That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? __eou__ No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . __eou__ So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . __eou__ I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! __eou__ It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ?
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer .
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !
Do you think children watch too much Tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself .
Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? __eou__ Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? __eou__ Who ’ s it about ? __eou__ It ’ s about Bob Dylan . __eou__ Who is he ? __eou__ He ’ s a famous American musician . __eou__ Who ’ s the author ? __eou__ It was written by Howard Sounds . __eou__ What do you think about it ? __eou__ It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . __eou__ Can I read it when you ’ re done ? __eou__ Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . __eou__ How many chapters does the book have ? __eou__ There are 15 chapters in total . __eou__ When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? __eou__ I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . __eou__ Thanks . Charlie ! __eou__ No problem . Bob .
How many people are in your family ? __eou__ As you know , China has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I .

But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . __eou__ And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ You're right . Thank you for the advice .
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking .

How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day .
Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? __eou__ I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__ This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__ I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . __eou__ Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . __eou__ There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . __eou__ I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . __eou__ I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes !
So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . __eou__ That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . __eou__ So , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
Judy , what is everybody talking about ? __eou__ Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__ Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__ Me too .

You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you .
You look upset , is there anything wrong ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! __eou__ Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk .

Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . __eou__ Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . __eou__ Really ? That's wonderful ! __eou__ Thank you for your warning . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ Be careful of yourself .

Anything else ? __eou__ We still prefer French dressing . __eou__ Will you say it again ? __eou__ Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ?
Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? __eou__ Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it ! __eou__ Do you put your feet on your own table ? __eou__ No , I never do that . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I don't want to mark my table , of course . __eou__ Well , will you please put them down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't come back so early . __eou__ I forgot something on the table . __eou__ Oh , you've got a good memory .

Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right .

I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news .

To welcome the new year of course ? __eou__ And also to frighten away evil spirits . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . __eou__ Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels .
Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . __eou__ Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . __eou__ So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . __eou__ Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ?
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good . Let's go now . __eou__ All right .

This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school .
So , how'd everyone do ? __eou__ Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? __eou__ Your vintage clock ? !

I think bargaining is in my blood ! __eou__ Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining !
Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . __eou__ Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . __eou__ Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? __eou__ We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! __eou__ Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! __eou__ Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! __eou__ Is that why you missed work today ? __eou__ Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . __eou__ Www ! __eou__ I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! __eou__ Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . __eou__ Oh , yeah . I ’ m there !

And this is Holly's potato salad . __eou__ You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ... __eou__ Let me know if I can help .
How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . __eou__ You're right . We're not really into used stuff . __eou__ Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! __eou__ There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . __eou__ I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__ Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping !
What do you think of this one ? __eou__ Eh , so so . __eou__ And this one ? Too flashy ? __eou__ Nah , not too flashy . __eou__ Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ?

I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . __eou__ And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! __eou__ Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! __eou__ Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ And that ? __eou__ It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . __eou__ Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city !

My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” __eou__ Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . __eou__ She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly .
Holly , I just heard some terrible news . __eou__ Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . __eou__ What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . __eou__ That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . __eou__ Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? __eou__ No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me !
Is that true ? __eou__ I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . __eou__ Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! __eou__ That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . __eou__ She's glowing .

You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ...
Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? __eou__ I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . __eou__ Is rice your staple food , too ? __eou__ Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread .
Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited ! __eou__ Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ? __eou__ You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! __eou__ Really ? What kind of prizes ? __eou__ Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! __eou__ A new car ! You're kidding ! __eou__ No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! __eou__ Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? __eou__ Of course !

Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . __eou__ I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ?
Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ? __eou__ Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies . __eou__ They're beautiful . Taylor , you're so pale and skinny ! __eou__ Of course I'm pale . It's just now the beginning of spring . I don't have my summer tan yet . __eou__ I guess . Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? __eou__ I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun ..
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ?

Hey , Lily ! You won't believe what happened in class today ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class ! __eou__ Cool ! I wish I could have been there ! __eou__ Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ? __eou__ Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die .
And lots of " Dear Abby " sob stories ... __eou__ Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ No wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! __eou__ Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... __eou__ You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ?
Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! __eou__ You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... __eou__ And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? __eou__ No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... __eou__ And they said you should play classical music ? __eou__ How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter !
Are you ready to go shopping ? __eou__ Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . __eou__ What research ? __eou__ Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? __eou__ But they're just ads ... __eou__ Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ...
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ Teresa Jones got a boob job . __eou__ Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ...
And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant ! __eou__ Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover . __eou__ OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ? __eou__ Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . __eou__ So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? __eou__ I guess I'm lending them to you ...
... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! __eou__ She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . __eou__ Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! __eou__ Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? __eou__ Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__ Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl !
Where are we headed now ? __eou__ To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . __eou__ Awesome . Was someone killed there ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . __eou__ Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? __eou__ Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat .
Are you sure it was him ? __eou__ I used to date him . Of course it was him . __eou__ You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? __eou__ Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . __eou__ Maybe he was just visiting someone . __eou__ But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has " cancer patient " written all over his face .
The weekend's finally here ! __eou__ And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that . __eou__ Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . __eou__ Sounds good . What do we need to bring ? __eou__ We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . __eou__ I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan .
Taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! __eou__ Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out . __eou__ Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . __eou__ You're like the tenth person to say that . __eou__ We're just worried about you , Taylor . __eou__ Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone !
Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! __eou__ Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . __eou__ Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? __eou__ Maybe ... __eou__ Some of my grappa will cure your shyness . __eou__ Is that a kind of alcohol ? __eou__ It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! __eou__ Great . My face will turn even redder !
Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . __eou__ Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . __eou__ Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . __eou__ I'll take over for a while to give you a break . __eou__ Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce . __eou__ Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that !
Does anyone need a drink ? __eou__ I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? __eou__ It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! __eou__ Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? __eou__ No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? __eou__ No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving .
Hey , the pool's open now ! __eou__ As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . __eou__ So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... __eou__ ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . __eou__ Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . __eou__ That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it !
OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! __eou__ Why ? Are they good ? __eou__ They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! __eou__ I'm ready ! Whoa , what a hard throw ! I can't get that ! __eou__ Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... __eou__ Ummmph !
Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus . __eou__ Why ? Did you open an attachment ? __eou__ Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . __eou__ I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . __eou__ I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . __eou__ Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same !
Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? __eou__ No . What did it say ? __eou__ There's a garage sale around the corner . __eou__ A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? __eou__ What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? __eou__ I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about !
What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . __eou__ It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . __eou__ Such a thing exists ? __eou__ Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! __eou__ Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . __eou__ You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ...
Wanna chill out and watch cable ? __eou__ Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? __eou__ It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . __eou__ This show is like a black Friends . __eou__ BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV . __eou__ That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable .
Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . __eou__ It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . __eou__ They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . __eou__ Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__ Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . __eou__ Ha-ha ! You got me there !
Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! __eou__ Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . __eou__ Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures . __eou__ Those clothes do suit him better . __eou__ Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? __eou__ Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ?
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . __eou__ Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . __eou__ Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . __eou__ Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it .
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! __eou__ Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . __eou__ An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . __eou__ Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . __eou__ GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? __eou__ Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts __eou__ Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? __eou__ Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! __eou__ No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! __eou__ Umm . . . That's the spirit !
You want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Sure ! What ' s playing ? __eou__ The new Twilight movie ! __eou__ Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies !
Are you excited about your trip next month ? __eou__ Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__ Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . __eou__ You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__ I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . __eou__ Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . __eou__ Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . __eou__ We are such weirdos right ?
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !
Let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ OK ! How about Scrabble ? __eou__ No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ OK ! __eou__ Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny .
What are you doing ? __eou__ What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ Mumm . no . __eou__ It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match .
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time !
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__ Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__ That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !
Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__ Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party !
Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? __eou__ I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . __eou__ Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . __eou__ So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? __eou__ Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ I hope you are right .
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ?
Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! __eou__ Are you trying to lose weight ? __eou__ Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . __eou__ You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . __eou__ Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? __eou__ Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . __eou__ So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? __eou__ Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . __eou__ If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? __eou__ Don ’ t count on it .
It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! __eou__ I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__ Do you have a New Year's resolution ? __eou__ I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . __eou__ Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . __eou__ That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . __eou__ Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! __eou__ Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck !
Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in !
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture !
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . __eou__ I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . __eou__ You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__ I ’ ll drink to that !
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize !
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine .
Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ? __eou__ What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? __eou__ Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms !
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving .
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__ Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol !
Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . __eou__ Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . __eou__ That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! __eou__ Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! __eou__ Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores __eou__ What an amazing goal !
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? __eou__ Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ?
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . __eou__ Yes . I like it very much . __eou__ Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . __eou__ It's excellent . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . __eou__ It's delicious . __eou__ What sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__ I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? __eou__ I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__ Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . __eou__ It's still early .
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven .
Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . __eou__ A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? __eou__ There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . __eou__ I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . __eou__ What about sunday ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . __eou__ Maybe next week . __eou__ Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . __eou__ Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . __eou__ I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
Something wrong ? __eou__ Yes . My car is having problems . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ It won't start . __eou__ Do you want me to take a look ? __eou__ No , thank you . I think I can handle it . __eou__ Well , if you change your mind , let me know . __eou__ I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? __eou__ Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . __eou__ Thanks . That would be very helpful . __eou__ Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__ OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company .

You ’ re going away next week . __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ May I know your name , please ? __eou__ I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? __eou__ Ah , yes .

Did you get admit to MIT ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Really going to miss you . __eou__ Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . __eou__ Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey . __eou__ Look after yourself . Bye . __eou__ Bye .
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ No , thank you . I can ’ t . __eou__ It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__ Thanks for coming !

Bye ! Ben .
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies .
I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . __eou__ Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__ So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . __eou__ I know . I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm . It was pouring with rain all afternoon . __eou__ We really have some movable weather sometime . I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . __eou__ If it was sunning all year round there would be drought . You probably would not like it either . __eou__ I guess you are right . Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__ The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . Our weather is so changeable .
What are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . __eou__ Does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ What are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ? __eou__ Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot .

I'm going on a cruise this summer . __eou__ No kidding ? __eou__ My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . __eou__ You can't beat that .
I don't know whether or not to believe him . __eou__ You can trust him . He always tells the truth . __eou__ But it's really too important to me . __eou__ I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it .
I love ice cream . __eou__ Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__ Chocolate is mine .
What do you think of shopping ? __eou__ I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs . __eou__ What do you think of big department store ? __eou__ It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need .
You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . __eou__ Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name .

Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? __eou__ Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? __eou__ No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . __eou__ Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . __eou__ What's the temperature today anyway ? __eou__ I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius .
Well , what brings you here ? __eou__ I came to see my aunt . __eou__ Does she live nearby ? __eou__ Yes . She lives on the next block .
Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? __eou__ Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? __eou__ Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . __eou__ Great , so what happens now ? __eou__ Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? __eou__ No , I first came here 1995 . __eou__ Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ? __eou__ Well , I am from Canada . Actually . __eou__ Oh , I am so sorry . __eou__ That ' ok . That's happens all the time .

I was still tired from Saturday .
So Janet , do you do any sports ? __eou__ Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . __eou__ Yeah , how often do you go ? __eou__ About three times a week if I can . __eou__ Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? __eou__ Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though .
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . __eou__ If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . __eou__ No way , if it still has 21 .
I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? __eou__ Me ? I prefer France . __eou__ I went to France last summer . __eou__ Oh , really ? I went to China last winter !
It seems a glorious day today . __eou__ I agree ... __eou__ It's beginning to spot . __eou__ Just now we both thought it would be fine .
Show us our itineraries , please . __eou__ We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet . __eou__ How long will the trip take ? __eou__ At least 20 days .
They must be your parents , what do they do ? __eou__ My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . __eou__ Do they often take you out ? __eou__ No , usually they're very busy .
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure .
What's the name of the series just showed ? __eou__ Doctor Butcher . __eou__ What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ? __eou__ No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit .
Do you like watching TV ? __eou__ Yes I do , usually . __eou__ What do you exactly mean by usually ? __eou__ I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV .
Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? __eou__ I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . __eou__ It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . __eou__ I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home .
What's your favorite TV Program ? __eou__ I like variety shows . __eou__ I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . __eou__ I prefer a variety show without a host .
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . __eou__ It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? __eou__ Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . __eou__ Wow , I doubt that .
Do you take a bus to and from work ? __eou__ Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . __eou__ Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . __eou__ Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__ That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__ What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__ You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! __eou__ Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? __eou__ Yeah , absolutely ! __eou__ And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . __eou__ You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy .
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true .
Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . __eou__ I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . __eou__ I am going there , too . We can walk together . __eou__ Sure .
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? __eou__ Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .
I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . __eou__ Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? __eou__ No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! __eou__ Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? __eou__ Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . __eou__ You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? __eou__ My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . __eou__ If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . __eou__ That would be great ! Thanks a lot !
Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? __eou__ How about Great Canyon ? __eou__ Is it worth seeing ? __eou__ Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works .
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable .
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world .
Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ? __eou__ I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? __eou__ Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? __eou__ No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? __eou__ I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles . __eou__ Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . __eou__ Have you been to California ? __eou__ Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast . __eou__ How many kids do you have ? __eou__ Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now . __eou__ Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime .
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog .
Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? __eou__ I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . __eou__ Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__ It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ...
The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . __eou__ I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . __eou__ Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? __eou__ Now you're talking .
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? __eou__ Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ Sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared .
Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare .
How can I tell her about this ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__ There is no need to be so frustrated . __eou__ How can you live without job in the future ?
Why are you in such a hurry ? __eou__ I should finish it as soon as possible . __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step __eou__ Why can I learn it ? __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step . __eou__ I feel I really stupid .
Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ Two tickets , please . How much are they ? __eou__ Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ Are these seats okay ? __eou__ They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn .
How are you getting along with your wife now ? __eou__ What can you expect ? Not that good . __eou__ What are you going to do then ? __eou__ Just let it go . __eou__ How are your work now ? __eou__ Not bad , just let it go .
Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . __eou__ And what ’ s the problem ? __eou__ When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . __eou__ And you want to know what to wear ? __eou__ Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . __eou__ That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? __eou__ Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . __eou__ My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party .
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__ Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__ Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__ Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first .
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . __eou__ It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come .
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage .
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps .
Do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . __eou__ To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ What about your mother ? Did she help you ? __eou__ Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . __eou__ Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . __eou__ No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that .
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Do you like sports , Janice ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me .
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? __eou__ You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . __eou__ Hey !
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better .
I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ Believe what ? __eou__ You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... __eou__ You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ Do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China .
How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search .
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent .
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .
Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? __eou__ I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . __eou__ Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? __eou__ Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . __eou__ How did you get involved in something like that ? __eou__ Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . __eou__ So what do you do there ? __eou__ It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . __eou__ Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? __eou__ Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? __eou__ I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... __eou__ Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ?
Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? __eou__ Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . __eou__ Congratulations !
Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . __eou__ I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . __eou__ They spend hours there , especially on weekends . __eou__ Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ Isn ’ t that complicated ? __eou__ No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . __eou__ We ? Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ Sure . I love going to the mall . __eou__ What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__ Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__ Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this .
What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . __eou__ Do you mind if I come along sometime ? __eou__ No , not at all . Glad to have you .
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . __eou__ Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . __eou__ That ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__ Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office !
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin .
Can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ What are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . __eou__ Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ He got arrested all right . __eou__ If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . __eou__ That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .
Hi , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Don . What a surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . __eou__ Have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . __eou__ Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . __eou__ Sure . Join my class next week .
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . __eou__ Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . __eou__ You're becoming a real television watcher . __eou__ A lot of people feel the same way .

What do you think of the play showed last night ? __eou__ I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . __eou__ Yes , I turned it off when the fight got heated in it . __eou__ It's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway .

I wonder if we can change to Channel 26 . __eou__ Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel . __eou__ A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like . __eou__ I prefer boxing to beef .
What channel did you watch last night ? __eou__ Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . __eou__ You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? __eou__ It was very good . I followed it right to the end .

What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ? __eou__ I like almost all kinds of music .

I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? __eou__ That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . __eou__ Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime .
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ...
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news .

I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then .
The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! __eou__ I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! __eou__ That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? __eou__ Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning .
Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . __eou__ Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! __eou__ We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__ The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__ I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . __eou__ Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__ Let's hope it is !
Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . __eou__ How long is the holiday ? __eou__ It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . __eou__ Do you eat any special food for the festival ? __eou__ Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . __eou__ That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's really wonderful ! __eou__ Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . __eou__ I'm sure you'll have a good time .
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . __eou__ I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight !
I can't believe it ! I lost . __eou__ It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie ! __eou__ That's not fair , you got all the easy questions . __eou__ I guess that's just the luck of the draw . __eou__ I want a rematch . Let's play again . __eou__ Sorry , not tonight !
OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola . __eou__ Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! __eou__ Only about old movies , really ...
All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . __eou__ What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? __eou__ Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! __eou__ Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages . __eou__ Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ... __eou__ Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ...
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . __eou__ Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it .
I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! __eou__ But they are so silly ! They're not art ! __eou__ That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? __eou__ James Cameron , of course . __eou__ Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? __eou__ Well , nobody's perfect !
I never watch foreign films . They're too boring . __eou__ Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie . __eou__ Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! __eou__ I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . __eou__ Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . __eou__ No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured !
How's your new job going ? __eou__ Really well , thanks . __eou__ How are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ Would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ How about your new co-workers ? __eou__ They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ Do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ Do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ Do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do .
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__ I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__ I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__ no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__ I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__ do you speak Spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__ I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__ I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then !
OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ? __eou__ Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ? __eou__ Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures . __eou__ OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s . __eou__ Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer .
How did your interview go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__ If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ Will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ That makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__ My boss . __eou__ What kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ Those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ What do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do .
Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! __eou__ Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__ No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? __eou__ Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! __eou__ Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! __eou__ I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?
Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? __eou__ Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! __eou__ I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . __eou__ I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ?
Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . __eou__ Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? __eou__ Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__ Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant .
You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! __eou__ I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . __eou__ I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee . __eou__ Thanks . Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table . __eou__ I'm Robert , at your service . __eou__ Rita . Nice to meet you .
How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . __eou__ Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! __eou__ Sure , why not ? I could use a rest .
Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . __eou__ OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? __eou__ Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . __eou__ Froth ? __eou__ If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . __eou__ Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one .
Who got ripped off ? __eou__ Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? __eou__ Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . __eou__ Now we're getting to the truth . __eou__ There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . __eou__ See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous .
I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... __eou__ Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? __eou__ Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones . __eou__ So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? __eou__ Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! __eou__ Let me see it ! It's so small !
What does this have to do with me ? __eou__ You know all about coffee . I need your advice , so I won't look stupid when I order . __eou__ Order tea . Isn't that what you like to drink ? __eou__ Come on , Hugh ! Tea is for wimps ! Please , I need your help . __eou__ If you want to be macho , order a double shot of espresso . __eou__ Now you're talking . That sounds good . What is it ?
I'm more worried about snipers . __eou__ Snipers ? __eou__ Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . __eou__ So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? __eou__ I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . __eou__ Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders .
I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . __eou__ Please don't tell me you bought it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ If you did , you probably got ripped off .
Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! __eou__ Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? __eou__ Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . __eou__ You've gone bonkers , Jen . __eou__ It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . __eou__ OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet .
You're so witty ... __eou__ So why is the face tilted to the right ? __eou__ This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . __eou__ So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? __eou__ It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . __eou__ I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... __eou__ Bingo !
What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? __eou__ It's a camera . __eou__ You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? __eou__ Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . __eou__ What's that supposed to mean ? __eou__ Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere .
Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . __eou__ If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . __eou__ What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__ Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__ Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . __eou__ OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink .
Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . __eou__ Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . __eou__ He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! __eou__ Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful .
What's the matter with you , Paul ? __eou__ I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ Yeah , I will .
Do you have cold medicine ? __eou__ Yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . __eou__ I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? __eou__ Then you can buy Aspirin . __eou__ I will take the Aspirin then . And have you a small first-aid kit ? __eou__ Yes , here this is . __eou__ I'll take it too . __eou__ Thank you and take care .
You look pale , Paul.What ' s wrong ? __eou__ I've got a headache . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that.Anything I can do for you ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes .
You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? __eou__ I had to look after my son at home . __eou__ What's wrong with him ? __eou__ He has a fever . __eou__ Is he getting better now ? __eou__ I think so.Thank you .
I heard you've found a new job . __eou__ Yes , I'm now working in a company . __eou__ So you're quite happy with your new job ? __eou__ Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
And what's your vision ? __eou__ 20/350 . __eou__ Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... __eou__ They don't have toilets at the campground ? __eou__ Let's just say I'll have it easy ...
Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame . __eou__ Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either . __eou__ You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ... __eou__ Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ? __eou__ I know they're out there . I'll find them . __eou__ You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ?
I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? __eou__ That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? __eou__ To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . __eou__ It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . __eou__ Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? __eou__ Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work .
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ No , really ? __eou__ Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ Who will be there ? __eou__ James is going to be packed off there . __eou__ That is good . He can leave you alone this time .
Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck . __eou__ Guess what ? He has just got the sack . __eou__ Oh , is that so ? __eou__ Exactly .
Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__ That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__ It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__ That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__ Certainly .
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then .
I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__ Then keep up the good work .
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__ Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__ Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . __eou__ Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__ Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__ I will do my best .
Is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best . __eou__ That ’ s the way to go .
Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__ I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__ Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__ Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
Let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? __eou__ You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . __eou__ In what ? __eou__ In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! __eou__ Can you do the vault ? __eou__ I do back flips at the pool all the time .
Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? __eou__ Are you sure ? How do you know ? __eou__ Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! __eou__ Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ...
I don't know . I think you might be over the hill . __eou__ Well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . __eou__ Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ? __eou__ Since 1996 it has been . And I bet I'd be pretty good at it . I ride my mountain bike to work almost every day .
How do I look in this new dress ? __eou__ You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . __eou__ How about this one ? __eou__ It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well .
Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious . __eou__ It's okay . __eou__ Next time , it's on me . __eou__ Don't be silly . __eou__ I'm serious . __eou__ Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors . __eou__ Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . __eou__ Definitely . I really like Italian food .
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I have to work overtime . __eou__ You are really career minded . __eou__ My boss promised to pay me double time .
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .
Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? __eou__ Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . __eou__ Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? __eou__ I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__ It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__ Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible .
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? __eou__ I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile .
How long have you been in this company ? __eou__ I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . __eou__ You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__ Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__ Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__ It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard .
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ How regular ? __eou__ An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__ But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ That ’ s not right , somebody should do something .
And lots of Dear Abby sob stories ... __eou__ Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ No wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! __eou__ Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... __eou__ You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ?
How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? __eou__ Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . __eou__ You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? __eou__ I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . __eou__ Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? __eou__ I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . __eou__ How's your current job going ? __eou__ I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities .
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? __eou__ Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__ It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__ You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__ Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__ It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
I think I need a new notebook . __eou__ Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ That's a notebook ? __eou__ Believe it ! __eou__ It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase !
Uh ... that's Greek to me . __eou__ That means they have tapered legs . __eou__ Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . __eou__ Mine are , too . __eou__ So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . __eou__ Yeah . Let's just lounge around !
You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . __eou__ What was your childhood like ? __eou__ I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . __eou__ Where did you go to university ? __eou__ My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . __eou__ What is your current occupation ? __eou__ I am a journalist . I write for China Daily .
Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? __eou__ Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__ Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__ Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it .
That way they look longer . __eou__ Now what are you doing ? __eou__ Putting on mascara . __eou__ Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . __eou__ I won't . __eou__ And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? __eou__ Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . __eou__ I guess I need all of them . __eou__ Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . __eou__ I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . __eou__ Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock .
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? __eou__ Yep . And it breathes , see ! __eou__ It's not breathing ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . __eou__ Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ I would look so cool carrying this around !
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__ What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__ He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__ You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__ That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him .
I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? __eou__ You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !
I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . __eou__ That ’ s a matter of opinion . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career .
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived !
Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason . __eou__ Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ... __eou__ But what ? __eou__ But he is always talking big .
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ Great !
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . __eou__ Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... __eou__ Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__ Don't worry , I've gotchy covered .
I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . __eou__ I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... __eou__ What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? __eou__ It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air .
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ That is a big family . How old is your sister ? __eou__ 15 . __eou__ What about your brother ? __eou__ He ’ s not quite 25 . __eou__ Do you miss your family ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Do you often go home ? __eou__ No . But I write to them often . __eou__ How often do you write to them ? __eou__ Once a month .

Thank you for coming . __eou__ So see you . __eou__ Bye .
Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! __eou__ Yeah . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . At least I am still alive . __eou__ Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . __eou__ You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__ Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl .
Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . __eou__ Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . __eou__ I don't want to make a bad impression . __eou__ Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . __eou__ I will . __eou__ One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . __eou__ I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? __eou__ Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . __eou__ What's the extension number for my phone ? __eou__ The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . __eou__ Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? __eou__ Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers .

But it seldom rains in autumn __eou__ I feel it ’ s rather dry here __eou__ That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here . __eou__ Are you from south ? __eou__ No . I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . __eou__ I see . So this is your hometown ?
How nice it is here __eou__ You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ’ s pleasant raise . it ’ s so lovely __eou__ I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year __eou__ That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring

Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__ Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there .
I am having a hard time at my job . __eou__ What's wrong , Julia ? __eou__ My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . __eou__ Don't give up so soon . __eou__ But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . __eou__ Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . __eou__ Tell that to my boss . __eou__ Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . __eou__ He was also assassinated because of his views . __eou__ He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . __eou__ Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . __eou__ That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream .
So , how's your work ? __eou__ Good . How about you ? __eou__ I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . __eou__ But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . __eou__ That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . __eou__ That's why I am going to leave . __eou__ But you have already worked there for five years . __eou__ I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . __eou__ Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . __eou__ Thank you . I will .
You look tired . __eou__ Yeah , I've been working so much overtime lately . __eou__ Really ? How come ? __eou__ My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult . __eou__ You shouldn't work so hard . __eou__ I know , but hard work pays off . You know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for .
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . __eou__ No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . __eou__ But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? __eou__ Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ That's nice . Where is his villa ? __eou__ It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . __eou__ Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . __eou__ Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ I know , but I am a work maniac . __eou__ Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . __eou__ Have a nice weekend . __eou__ You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend .

Did you see May today ? __eou__ Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? __eou__ I don't have the foggiest idea . __eou__ I thought she'd be happy . __eou__ Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . __eou__ I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem .
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there .

That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? __eou__ Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? __eou__ That's a big question .

What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? __eou__ I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . __eou__ What do you like best about it ? __eou__ I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . __eou__ What do you think of the ending ? __eou__ The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories .
So what did you think about the movie ? __eou__ Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . __eou__ Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . __eou__ You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . __eou__ It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . __eou__ Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . __eou__ I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . __eou__ I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . __eou__ Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? __eou__ No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . __eou__ Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . __eou__ I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? __eou__ I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . __eou__ Okay , let's go !
Here is the song list . __eou__ Do you have any English songs ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Let me have a look . Everything I do I do it for you 、 Unchained melody 、 My heart will go on .

You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well . __eou__ I used to be a better singer . I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time . It's your turn . __eou__ I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging , first in Chinese then in English . __eou__ That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song .
As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . __eou__ It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . __eou__ Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . __eou__ For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . __eou__ That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
What's your hobby ? __eou__ Photograph . __eou__ What's the make of your camera ? __eou__ Olympus . __eou__ Do you own your own darkroom ? __eou__ No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money .

Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . __eou__ Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . __eou__ But what are the sources of water pollution ? __eou__ They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources . __eou__ Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . __eou__ But what about the indirect ones ? __eou__ Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . __eou__ I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . __eou__ Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation .
Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . __eou__ Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . __eou__ People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . __eou__ Nothing seems to be happier for them .
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . __eou__ Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again . __eou__ How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! __eou__ Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please !
Are you a happy married man ? __eou__ Yes , I am . My wife and I understand each other . __eou__ You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . __eou__ I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . __eou__ You mean she bosses her husband around ? __eou__ That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life .
I hear Jean married a business tycoon . __eou__ That's true . Her husband is a fat cat . __eou__ But I don't think she really loves him . __eou__ She is only after his money . __eou__ If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . __eou__ But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough .
The Blacks got divorced . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side . __eou__ Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? __eou__ No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . __eou__ Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? __eou__ No .

She is a gem . __eou__ Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she ’ s just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself . __eou__ Oh ? ! Did you talk with her about it ? __eou__ I've tried , but it didn't work . __eou__ So , when are you going to tell her ? __eou__ Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her . __eou__ I know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt ! __eou__ I know ...
Hi , Is that David ? __eou__ Hi , Jenny . It's David here . __eou__ Hey , what's new ? __eou__ Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . __eou__ Sorry to hear that . What happened ? __eou__ Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . __eou__ Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . __eou__ What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . __eou__ But she lied to me . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? __eou__ Ok , then . __eou__ But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . __eou__ What face ? __eou__ The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . __eou__ Yeah , I know . You are right .

And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too . __eou__ I sure hope so .
I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Where is she going to college ? __eou__ She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . __eou__ Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !
Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? __eou__ My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__ Did you finish typing yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? __eou__ Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . __eou__ How about the shelf ? __eou__ I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? __eou__ Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . __eou__ I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__ Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__ You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__ My poor memory . Thank you very much .

If you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . It's extremely bad for your health , you know . __eou__ I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it . __eou__ Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . __eou__ I'll try .
You look run down , Brian . __eou__ I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . __eou__ Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . __eou__ I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . __eou__ Good idea .
Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea . __eou__ It's easy to get loose bowels in summer . __eou__ It may have something to do with the food I had last night __eou__ You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat . __eou__ I will . Thank you .
Steve , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress .
Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . __eou__ I had to go get a cavity filled today . __eou__ Did it hurt ? __eou__ I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! __eou__ How long were you in the chair ? __eou__ It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . __eou__ Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . __eou__ No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! __eou__ Don't you have a dental insurance ? __eou__ I do , but it still does not cover everything .
Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? __eou__ Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__ Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__ Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__ Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . __eou__ Really ? No , they couldn't . None of them would have jobs if they did .
Hi , John ! How was your vacation ? __eou__ We went to Malaysia and Thailand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia . __eou__ Wow , isn't that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating .
Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome .
What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? __eou__ We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River . __eou__ How hard is the climb ? __eou__ It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ What did you do last week ? __eou__ We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . __eou__ Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__ Ok , see you .
Aren ’ t you going to swim ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__ Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . __eou__ All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . __eou__ Jim ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . __eou__ I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? __eou__ Are you serious ? That will be wonderful !
Did you go camping last Saturday ? __eou__ We went to the coast .

But we still enjoyed ourselves .
Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . __eou__ Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . __eou__ Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . __eou__ I hope it's not gonna break into three digits __eou__ But it's already awfully close . __eou__ Well , I just hope it'll level off . __eou__ I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . __eou__ I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long .
So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone .

Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room .

Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ We've been planting trees for many years . __eou__ I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . __eou__ But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . __eou__ Then what about spring ? __eou__ Spring is warm and short in Beijing . __eou__ It must be cold in the winter , though . __eou__ You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . Don't forget to put on more clothes , or you might catch a cold . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . __eou__ You're welcome .
Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . __eou__ You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later .
Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . __eou__ Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . __eou__ That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again .
What ? __eou__ What happened with that guy at the cafe ? __eou__ nothing __eou__ But you ’ re crazy about him ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? __eou__ I don ’ t actually know him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . __eou__ Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail .
Does bullfight interest you much ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . __eou__ So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . __eou__ What is it ?
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock'n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal .
Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? __eou__ Yes I am . And you ... __eou__ I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . __eou__ So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . __eou__ My pleasure .
Who is this on the water buffalo ? __eou__ That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . __eou__ Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . __eou__ My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . __eou__ That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__ My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__ So he became a self-taught man ? __eou__ Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . __eou__ In what field ? __eou__ As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . __eou__ Is he still in that that type of work . __eou__ No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . __eou__ Would you want to be a senator ? __eou__ Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer .
He has lots of hobbies . __eou__ And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . __eou__ He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . __eou__ But as for his business in the city ... __eou__ He lets his cousins look after his business . __eou__ He sounds more like an artist than a businessman .
Let ’ s go to the seashore on Saturday . __eou__ Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting . __eou__ It ’ s expensive , too . Let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead . __eou__ Yes . Let ’ s sleep on the sand . That ’ s most exciting !
Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . __eou__ That's wonderful . Congratulations . __eou__ Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . __eou__ I'd love to .

That ’ s something unusual .
Hello , Ellen . __eou__ Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident . __eou__ Oh , no !

The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives .
Is this your umbrella , miss ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . __eou__ You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . __eou__ Have you ? __eou__ May I ask where you live ? __eou__ Just two blocks away , in that tall building . __eou__ That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . __eou__ My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . __eou__ It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? __eou__ I ’ m Chen Ming . __eou__ How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . __eou__ I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . __eou__ Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? __eou__ No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing .
Are the children all grown up now , Rose ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer . __eou__ Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . __eou__ She ’ s a librarian at the public library . __eou__ Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl . __eou__ Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer . __eou__ Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ? __eou__ Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him . __eou__ Really ? Where does he live now ? __eou__ Colorado . __eou__ And does Rocky drive a truck , too ? __eou__ Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot . __eou__ Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ? __eou__ Yes . Mostly to England and France .
Mom ? __eou__ Mm ? __eou__ Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? __eou__ Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? __eou__ Yes .
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God !
How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? __eou__ Seventy-six , I think .
I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting . __eou__ Neither can I .
Labor is an abundant resource here . __eou__ One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out .
This paper absorbs water so quickly ! __eou__ Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills .
Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . __eou__ We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . __eou__ Out ? What do you mean out ? __eou__ You know on a date , they are going to dinner . __eou__ Dad and mom ? __eou__ Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . __eou__ You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? __eou__ That ’ s right , once a week .

Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come . __eou__ That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? __eou__ Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . __eou__ So will I . Thank you .
So do you think I can take it ? __eou__ I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes . __eou__ I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing . __eou__ See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down . __eou__ You ’ re right .
What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? __eou__ Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter __eou__ Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? __eou__ Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . __eou__ Easy . It ’ s on me . __eou__ In that case , I ’ m right behind you .
Like to come over to our fancy dress party ? __eou__ Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow . __eou__ Well , then join us some other time . __eou__ Yeah . Thanks . And have fun !
Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? __eou__ All right , if that would make you happy . __eou__ So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess . __eou__ Well , nothing really serious .
Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... __eou__ Out of hand . __eou__ Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . __eou__ Where ’ d you meet him ? __eou__ Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... __eou__ About what ? __eou__ Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ...
Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . __eou__ Who ’ s that boy ? __eou__ Where ? __eou__ The one next to the telephone . __eou__ I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? __eou__ I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building .
How do you do ? I ’ m Parker . __eou__ How do you do ? Mr . Barker . __eou__ Parker . __eou__ Oh , Parker with a P ? __eou__ Yes , with a P . __eou__ Er ... I ’ m Barker . __eou__ Barker ? With a B . Of course . __eou__ Yes , with a B . __eou__ Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ? __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Parker .
He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . __eou__ Do you really ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I just think he deserves it .
Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? __eou__ Yes , she is . __eou__ Does she teach Chinese ? __eou__ No , she is an English teacher . __eou__ And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? __eou__ You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother .
I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . __eou__ I'll try to speak more clearly .
How did you two meet ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , it was completely accidental .
Hi , Bill . __eou__ Hi , Jim . __eou__ Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks . __eou__ He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy . __eou__ Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? __eou__ Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP .
My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . __eou__ That sounds great !
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game .
Thank you for your letter . __eou__ Is your waist any better ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . __eou__ I ’ m glad you are getting better . __eou__ And I was glad to receive your letter . __eou__ Then when will you be back again ? __eou__ I will be back again next Wednesday . __eou__ I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . __eou__ Bye .
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? __eou__ Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going .
Are you still working day and night ? __eou__ Not anymore . Now I work nine hours a day , and I get a good sleep almost every night . No more burning the candle at both ends .
Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? __eou__ Well , I have the day off from work . __eou__ That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . __eou__ Sounds nice . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . __eou__ Can I stop by ? __eou__ Sure . Any time .
We have to pick up Conrad before the party . __eou__ Alright , no problem . __eou__ We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 __eou__ Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ That's a gay bar . __eou__ Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? __eou__ I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? __eou__ Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . __eou__ Why doesn't he meet us outside ? __eou__ Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in . __eou__ Yeah , but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? __eou__ You sound like you're afraid . __eou__ I just wouldn't be comfortable . __eou__ You've never been in a gay bar before ? __eou__ No , never . __eou__ But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic . __eou__ Well ... __eou__ Listen . If you refuse to go in , Conrad will be offended.You don't hate gay people , do you ? __eou__ No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before . __eou__ Don't worry about it . There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . __eou__ Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . __eou__ I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? __eou__ Fine .
You're late . __eou__ I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ My phone ? __eou__ Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__ But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . __eou__ About what ? __eou__ You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ Do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__ Yes , let's go .
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize !
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . __eou__ How old is he today ? __eou__ It's his 50th birthday . __eou__ Well , wish him a happy birthday for me . __eou__ Sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? __eou__ I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . __eou__ Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . __eou__ Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . __eou__ Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . __eou__ Sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? __eou__ Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . __eou__ Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . __eou__ Say hello to your friends for me . __eou__ Likewise . See you later . __eou__ Bye !
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? __eou__ I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . __eou__ I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . __eou__ in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? __eou__ not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo __eou__ some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . __eou__ well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ?
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__ I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ Wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ Have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ That sure didn't last long !
how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help .
Are you interested in history ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__ Some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? __eou__ Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? __eou__ Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? __eou__ Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? __eou__ That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? __eou__ To be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__ What do you have in mind ? __eou__ I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? __eou__ Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ Not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? __eou__ Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . __eou__ That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? __eou__ It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__ Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ? __eou__ Sounds good . I'll see you then !
So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? __eou__ Yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ That's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__ Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? __eou__ I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ Did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ No . did you ? __eou__ Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ Yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ Most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__ That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__ I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__ Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too !
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself .
Let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ OK ! How about Scrabble ? __eou__ No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ OK ! __eou__ Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny .
Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve __eou__ That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout __eou__ That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . __eou__ It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? __eou__ Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . __eou__ We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . __eou__ Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . __eou__ Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . __eou__ This is gonna be a great barbecue !
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !
Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . __eou__ Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__ Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob .
I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . __eou__ Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? __eou__ Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . __eou__ All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . __eou__ Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! __eou__ Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? __eou__ It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise !
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__ Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__ That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !
What are you doing ? __eou__ What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ Mumm . no . __eou__ It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match .
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time !
Nice day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having . __eou__ We can't complain about the weather recently . __eou__ Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . __eou__ I wonder how long this weather can last . __eou__ I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family .
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !
Hi . What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I've been pretty busy . __eou__ Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . __eou__ Gotta go . Call me tonight . __eou__ Okay . Check you later .
Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control !
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__ Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__ No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__ And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__ Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job .
OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . __eou__ What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__ The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot __eou__ Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . __eou__ I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . __eou__ Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . __eou__ Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? __eou__ Hehe .. sure
I ’ m forming a music band . __eou__ Do you already know how to play an instrument ? __eou__ Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . __eou__ Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? __eou__ We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m a singer . __eou__ Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__ Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . __eou__ I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . __eou__ You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__ I ’ ll drink to that !
You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__ Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! __eou__ What !
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine .
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ What about all these other pieces ? __eou__ See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__ That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation !
Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__ Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave !
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course !
... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . __eou__ Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! __eou__ What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . __eou__ It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? __eou__ Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . __eou__ You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! __eou__ That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning .
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__ Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! __eou__ It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .
I am kind of nervous . __eou__ Nervous ? Why ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . __eou__ Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . __eou__ Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . __eou__ Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . __eou__ Alright . But will we sing ? __eou__ Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . __eou__ I don't know the words . __eou__ There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . __eou__ And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? __eou__ No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . __eou__ Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? __eou__ That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . __eou__ It doesn't sound like an English word . __eou__ It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . __eou__ Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . __eou__ Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise .
Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? __eou__ I am worried about the meeting this morning . __eou__ Why ? I think the meeting went well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . But what are you worried about ? __eou__ I'm afraid I was too rude . __eou__ Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? __eou__ Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . __eou__ I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . __eou__ You mean because you are a woman ? __eou__ Yes . And he is the president of the company . __eou__ Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . __eou__ I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . __eou__ I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . __eou__ Good . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative .
Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? __eou__ No . It's no problem.Are you American ? __eou__ Yes . And you ? __eou__ No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? __eou__ Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . __eou__ I don't think so . You are flattering me . __eou__ No , really . I can only hear a little accent . __eou__ Are you flying home ? __eou__ Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . __eou__ You were visiting Taiwan ? __eou__ No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . __eou__ Really ! You live in Taiwan ! __eou__ Yes . Why not ? __eou__ May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? __eou__ Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? __eou__ Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? __eou__ I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . __eou__ It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan . __eou__ No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? __eou__ No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ?
So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . __eou__ Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? __eou__ He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . __eou__ Where will it be ? __eou__ We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . __eou__ Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? __eou__ Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__ You seem excited about it . __eou__ Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . __eou__ Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . __eou__ Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . __eou__ The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? __eou__ It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . __eou__ Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . __eou__ That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . __eou__ Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here .
There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? __eou__ I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . __eou__ Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . __eou__ Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . __eou__ Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? __eou__ I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . __eou__ The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . __eou__ Hmm . I hope not .
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ And that ? __eou__ It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . __eou__ Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! __eou__ Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city !
Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? __eou__ I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture !
Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse ! __eou__ Out of the frying pan and into the fire .
Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? __eou__ What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? __eou__ Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms !
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again .
Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa .
Who are those guys ? __eou__ Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . __eou__ Oh . __eou__ Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! __eou__ All right ! __eou__ Here comes Jordan , though . __eou__ Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . __eou__ Which team do you think will win ? __eou__ The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? __eou__ We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . __eou__ How hard is the climb ? __eou__ It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ What did you do last week ? __eou__ We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__ O . K . See you .
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating .
Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? __eou__ No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . __eou__ I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough . __eou__ I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it . __eou__ It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . __eou__ I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? __eou__ I ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty . __eou__ O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . __eou__ Great , I ’ ll see you then . __eou__ See you .
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? __eou__ Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . __eou__ I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much .
We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading __eou__ That is preposterous ! __eou__ You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! __eou__ I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! __eou__ No ! The egg came first !
Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . __eou__ Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . __eou__ That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! __eou__ Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! __eou__ Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . __eou__ What an amazing goal !
Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? __eou__ At the drop of a hat .
What's bothering that guy ? __eou__ Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder .
Do you think you will ever work at that company again ? __eou__ When pigs fly !
That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? __eou__ I just took a shot in the dark .
All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! __eou__ Over my dead body you are !
Did you understand question number three ? __eou__ Not at all , I was totally in the dark .
I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . __eou__ But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . __eou__ Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . __eou__ You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? __eou__ No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? __eou__ Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__ Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? __eou__ Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . __eou__ That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? __eou__ Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily .
Will you be at the family reunion next year ? __eou__ Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water !
This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . __eou__ Have you done windsurfing before ? __eou__ No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Can you take a little advice from a friend ? __eou__ Sure . What ? __eou__ Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . __eou__ But I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . __eou__ Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ?
You are too picky . __eou__ No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there . __eou__ Which guy ? __eou__ The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . __eou__ I can't see him . Where ? __eou__ Right there . __eou__ Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... __eou__ Yes , it's Mel Gibson . __eou__ Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? __eou__ I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? __eou__ I can't do that . __eou__ Why not ?
I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . __eou__ That's okay . I can explain a little . __eou__ I don't want to lose all my money . __eou__ Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . __eou__ I guess you're right . __eou__ Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? __eou__ Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . __eou__ That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . __eou__ I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . __eou__ But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ So how much do you want to gamble ? __eou__ Maybe 500 dollars . __eou__ 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? __eou__ I don't want people to think I'm stingy . __eou__ That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you .
Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? __eou__ You can buy some of these nice butterflies . __eou__ No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . __eou__ What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? __eou__ Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . __eou__ Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . __eou__ Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? __eou__ If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? __eou__ Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . __eou__ Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . __eou__ Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . __eou__ Let's go ask about it .
So how much should I gamble ? __eou__ Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? __eou__ Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? __eou__ I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . __eou__ I want games that are all luck . __eou__ I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines . __eou__ Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice . __eou__ So what do you want to play then ? __eou__ Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . __eou__ Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! __eou__ Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . __eou__ Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too !
Why did she do that ? __eou__ I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue .
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? __eou__ Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ?
What do you want to do tomorrow night ? __eou__ What--is tomorrow night something special ? __eou__ It's Friday . We should go party . __eou__ I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . __eou__ Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . __eou__ Do you feel like dancing ? __eou__ Yes ? Why not ? __eou__ Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . __eou__ They aren't alcoholic ! __eou__ No , maybe they're not . But they're close . __eou__ So where should we go ? __eou__ Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . __eou__ You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . __eou__ The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? __eou__ It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . __eou__ No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . __eou__ It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? __eou__ Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . __eou__ No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! __eou__ It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? __eou__ Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . __eou__ Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? __eou__ Maybe .
I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it was very interesting . __eou__ What were the schools like ? __eou__ Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . __eou__ But you taught children , yes ? __eou__ Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . __eou__ They actually study after school ? __eou__ That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . __eou__ Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? __eou__ Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . __eou__ Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . __eou__ So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . __eou__ But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . __eou__ As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . __eou__ Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? __eou__ That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . __eou__ Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? __eou__ I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare .
The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay . __eou__ Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway .
Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic . __eou__ That's okay . Better late than never .
Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? __eou__ No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again .
He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? __eou__ You can't judge a book by its cover .
Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . __eou__ The bigger they are , the harder they fall .
I feel I work harder when I am under pressure . __eou__ Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun .
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? __eou__ No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder .
I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . __eou__ Great minds think alike .
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !
I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while .
What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s __eou__ Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors .
Do you believe in UFO's ? __eou__ Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__ I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ Do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ I think there must be . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__ Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ No , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ I suppose you're right . __eou__ I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? __eou__ There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon .
I haven't met you at the gym for a long time . __eou__ yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . __eou__ why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . __eou__ it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . __eou__ then SOHO is your ideal work style . __eou__ yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . __eou__ and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . __eou__ absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . __eou__ sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? __eou__ yeah , I can find enough online . __eou__ it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit . __eou__ thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project .
Mike , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . __eou__ I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . __eou__ YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . __eou__ Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . __eou__ On second thought , I think I'll join you . __eou__ They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . __eou__ Wow , they really went to town on this place ! __eou__ Quite a difference , huh ? __eou__ Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . __eou__ When in Rome , do as the Romans do .
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ sure , but how ? __eou__ you can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ easier said than done . __eou__ you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ but I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ good luck !
Jack and Mary broke up . __eou__ it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ poor Mary ! She really liked him . __eou__ anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . __eou__ do you think they ’ ll get back together ? __eou__ no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . __eou__ I hope she ’ ll recover soon . __eou__ so do I .
hello , Deva , how are you ? __eou__ can't complain . What about you ? __eou__ not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ I've heard . She looks quite depressed . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon .
what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? __eou__ it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? __eou__ I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? __eou__ I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . __eou__ what other kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . __eou__ what kind of music do you prefer then ? __eou__ I like pop music . Do you ? __eou__ not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . __eou__ how long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ so , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . __eou__ do you still play piano ? __eou__ yes , it's one of my hobbies .
hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? __eou__ sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . __eou__ you're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink . __eou__ should I take my shoes off ? __eou__ whatever you prefer . __eou__ this is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? __eou__ just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? __eou__ sure , what do you have ? __eou__ I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . __eou__ I'll have a glass of red wine please . __eou__ one glass of red wine coming up ! __eou__ so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? __eou__ there's just going to be 6 of us tonight . __eou__ oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? __eou__ Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . __eou__ that's too bad.They ' re such good company . __eou__ I think there's someone at the door . __eou__ excuse me while I go and get that .
Hi , chary , are you busy this evening ? __eou__ sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . __eou__ what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . __eou__ how old is he today ? __eou__ it's his 50th birthday . __eou__ well , wish him a happy birthday for me . __eou__ sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? __eou__ I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . __eou__ well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . __eou__ sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . __eou__ sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . __eou__ sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? __eou__ sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . __eou__ yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . __eou__ say hello to your friends for me . __eou__ likewise . See you later . __eou__ Bye !
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . __eou__ that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . __eou__ the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . __eou__ I see how that can get a bit annoying . __eou__ a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . __eou__ so what are you going to do about it ? __eou__ I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . __eou__ what do you think would make you happier ? __eou__ in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . __eou__ relationships can be confusing sometimes . __eou__ what would you do if you were me ? __eou__ I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him !
so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? __eou__ I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? __eou__ I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ? __eou__ camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! __eou__ have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ? __eou__ no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go . __eou__ it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . __eou__ do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? __eou__ sure , would you like to see them ? __eou__ that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? __eou__ I have a Canon SLR . __eou__ so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . __eou__ I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ? __eou__ actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University . __eou__ have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? __eou__ yes , I was planning on going . Are you ? __eou__ yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . __eou__ that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ? __eou__ how about at 11:00 ? __eou__ sounds great . see you then .
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful .
what sort of music do you like ? __eou__ I love just about anything by Prince . __eou__ so , you're into 80s music then ? __eou__ well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? __eou__ I like alternative music . __eou__ do you have a favorite band ? __eou__ to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . __eou__ do you often go to concerts ? __eou__ I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? __eou__ I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? __eou__ there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . __eou__ I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . __eou__ that's too bad . Maybe another time . __eou__ let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . __eou__ I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? __eou__ sure , what's on ? __eou__ there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . __eou__ that sounds dreadful !
do you need a hand ? __eou__ no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway . __eou__ are you sure you don't need any help ? __eou__ well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit . __eou__ I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! __eou__ that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ? __eou__ yes . What about you ? __eou__ I'm in the middle seat . __eou__ oh , I guess I'll let you through then . __eou__ thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . __eou__ that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? __eou__ no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ? __eou__ I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . __eou__ I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours . __eou__ thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ? __eou__ that would be great . thanks .
Did you enjoy that new movie ? __eou__ That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . __eou__ Oh , what happened , Carole ? __eou__ I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . __eou__ What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . __eou__ Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? __eou__ Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? __eou__ His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . __eou__ I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . __eou__ I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ Doesn't sound promising . __eou__ Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . __eou__ Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class .
Hi , Mike , what gives ? __eou__ Hi , Bill , this is my new car . __eou__ Hey , great set of wheels . __eou__ You like it , huh ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . __eou__ It is special , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? __eou__ Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . __eou__ I can imagine . __eou__ Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Ok , let's go .
Hey , Jack , where's your car ? __eou__ I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . __eou__ Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? __eou__ Jump in , I'll give you a ride . __eou__ Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . __eou__ Yeah , it costed a bundle alright . __eou__ Wow , this's sinking a hole . __eou__ Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . __eou__ I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . __eou__ We are on the high way . I'm the * * . __eou__ Wow , this car can really burn rubber . __eou__ It's a great feeling . __eou__ You made a perfect choice , Jack . __eou__ Thanks , Daisy .
Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . __eou__ Don't mention it , let's go in . __eou__ Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? __eou__ She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? __eou__ A little , I wish I could do that . __eou__ You can ! With a little practice . __eou__ Look at him , he's buff . __eou__ I think he's hot too . __eou__ How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? __eou__ Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . __eou__ That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . __eou__ Good for you , Leslie !
wow ! You're going to Tibet ? __eou__ yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . __eou__ that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . __eou__ great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? __eou__ nothing particular . __eou__ why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . __eou__ oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune . __eou__ come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much . __eou__ ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? __eou__ the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . __eou__ then make sure that you book me a room , too . __eou__ I'll take care of it . __eou__ and check whether they accept credit cards . __eou__ no problem .
excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ? __eou__ oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . __eou__ I must have taken a wrong turn . __eou__ it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . __eou__ and then ? __eou__ take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . __eou__ by the way , how long does it take ? __eou__ without traffic , it takes about an hour . __eou__ I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? __eou__ yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . __eou__ great ! Thank you ! __eou__ my pleasure , and have a good time !
it's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . __eou__ is she American ? __eou__ yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? __eou__ not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__ thanks !
hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ it was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? __eou__ yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . __eou__ what else did you see ? __eou__ art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__ you must have had a great time . __eou__ yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . __eou__ yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . __eou__ that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ you'll have to try for yourself some day .
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ yeah , that's nice . __eou__ hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .
who are you writing a letter to ? __eou__ I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? __eou__ OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . __eou__ that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? __eou__ well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . __eou__ you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? __eou__ just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . __eou__ congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__ shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? __eou__ ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! __eou__ it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . __eou__ ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . __eou__ I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . __eou__ that's thoughtful of you . __eou__ and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . __eou__ that's right ! I almost forgot about that . __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__ we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other !
what are you looking for ? __eou__ I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . __eou__ do you know what camcorder options are available ? __eou__ not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . __eou__ would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? __eou__ sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . __eou__ ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? __eou__ it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? __eou__ it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . __eou__ can you also take still photos with this ? __eou__ yes , that is an option . __eou__ how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? __eou__ yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . __eou__ that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? __eou__ It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . __eou__ how does that compare with other models ? __eou__ there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . __eou__ I guess you can't have everything , can you ?
Is that your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__ does it have a camera ? __eou__ of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? __eou__ I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . __eou__ sure . Here you go . __eou__ have you checked your voicemail recently ? __eou__ no , why ? __eou__ I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . __eou__ oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . __eou__ do you want to listen to your messages first ? __eou__ no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . __eou__ I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . __eou__ I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? __eou__ it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . __eou__ how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? __eou__ it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! __eou__ let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age !
do you like playing games ? __eou__ I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . __eou__ how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? __eou__ the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! __eou__ if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . __eou__ how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? __eou__ I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! __eou__ I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__ hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . __eou__ it's a deal . __eou__ do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? __eou__ yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? __eou__ I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! __eou__ I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__ if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__ let's get started with this game then . __eou__ ok .
how did your interview go ? __eou__ pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__ if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__ my boss . __eou__ what kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ what do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do .
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? __eou__ well , you are a very hard-worker . __eou__ I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__ there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? __eou__ I could really use a 5 % rise . __eou__ that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . __eou__ listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . __eou__ that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . __eou__ that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? __eou__ of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . __eou__ that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . __eou__ you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling .
do you mind if I sit here ? __eou__ no , of course not . Go ahead . __eou__ don't I know you ? __eou__ yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__ you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__ What did you do after high school ? __eou__ I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? __eou__ I took a year off to go travelling . __eou__ that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? __eou__ I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? __eou__ I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__ Oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__ yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . __eou__ that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__ it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__ so you can speak Chinese ? __eou__ I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! __eou__ I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well .
the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? __eou__ I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . __eou__ where are you planning on going ? __eou__ I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . __eou__ would you recommend going there for a few days ? __eou__ personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . __eou__ you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? __eou__ it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? __eou__ I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . __eou__ maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . __eou__ I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . __eou__ since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . __eou__ thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later .
hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . And you ? __eou__ same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . __eou__ oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__ I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage .
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . __eou__ that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__ oh , why ? __eou__ I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . __eou__ I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__ well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? __eou__ I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . __eou__ or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . __eou__ a left girl ? What's that ? __eou__ they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , __eou__ you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__ that ' for sure but very few .
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us .
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? __eou__ what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? __eou__ but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . __eou__ okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . __eou__ sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . __eou__ well , we can ask people to make small contributions . __eou__ I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . __eou__ BYOB ? What's that ? __eou__ bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . __eou__ so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . __eou__ maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make __eou__ oh , that sounds like fun !
hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da __eou__ do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ thank you .
this party rocks ! __eou__ you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__ I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! __eou__ well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? __eou__ oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? __eou__ yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__ I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . __eou__ I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . __eou__ come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . __eou__ okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . __eou__ all right . But I think you ought to move soon . __eou__ why ? __eou__ I can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__ okay , here I go ! __eou__ good luck !
ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? __eou__ just after 2 am . __eou__ what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? __eou__ nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . __eou__ really ? What is it ? __eou__ I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? __eou__ I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? __eou__ I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c __eou__ just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free . You know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . I look forward to seeing you soon ! __eou__ me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there ! __eou__ thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! __eou__ talk to you later .
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__ I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__ well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? __eou__ it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . __eou__ well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ you're dancing so well . __eou__ you dance beautifully too . __eou__ when did you learn to dance ? __eou__ in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__ how about tango ? __eou__ oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? __eou__ Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . __eou__ thank you for the dance . __eou__ my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ ok .
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high IQ score . __eou__ well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go !
have you ever thought about your ideal home ? __eou__ I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__ what would it be like ? __eou__ well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__ how many rooms would it have ? __eou__ I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t __eou__ how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ how would you decorate your house ? __eou__ I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b __eou__ how many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__ that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__ all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . __eou__ thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ now let's have one together . __eou__ do you know how to set the timer ? __eou__ let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ cheese ... __eou__ did it come out ? __eou__ yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . __eou__ never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . __eou__ Ok , let's go .
finally we're on board ! __eou__ yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . __eou__ are they window seats or aisle seats ? __eou__ let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . __eou__ ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . __eou__ that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . __eou__ thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? __eou__ I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ don't forget to keep the seat belt on . __eou__ ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . __eou__ yes ! __eou__ and no hijackers . __eou__ oh , you have too wild of an imagination .
is this seat taken ? __eou__ no . please sit down . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ are you also going to Beijing ? __eou__ yes , on a business trip . How about you ? __eou__ I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? __eou__ yes , I went there once last summer . __eou__ really ? What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ was it that crowded ? __eou__ yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ thank you very much !
Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ? __eou__ Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . __eou__ Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker .
Matthew ? Hi ! __eou__ Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? __eou__ it's got to be almost a year now . __eou__ how have you been ? __eou__ I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . __eou__ yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? __eou__ not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . __eou__ well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? __eou__ Mrs . Thou ? __eou__ yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! __eou__ I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?
what's your apartment like ? __eou__ it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ how long is your contract for ? __eou__ that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ have you started looking again yet ? __eou__ not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ Good luck !
you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__ maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__ I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways .
you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . __eou__ thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . __eou__ how did you meet each other ? __eou__ she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . __eou__ is this your first date ? __eou__ yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . __eou__ sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . __eou__ oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? __eou__ absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! __eou__ then who will you meet tonight ? __eou__ a guy I met on the internet three month ago . __eou__ really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? __eou__ please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . __eou__ I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information .
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , Isabelle ... __eou__ Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__ yes , I am the guy . __eou__ what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__ how dare you ! __eou__ hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__ why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__ I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . __eou__ how about drinking soda ? __eou__ many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try __eou__ that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now !
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__ do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? __eou__ just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? __eou__ yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__ how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__ no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__ how did you get that burn again ? __eou__ I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__ no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__ I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__ I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? __eou__ just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . __eou__ sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too .
you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . __eou__ I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . __eou__ do you feel ok ? __eou__ not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . __eou__ why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__ could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? __eou__ you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . __eou__ ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . __eou__ Zach , what's that on your arm ? __eou__ I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . __eou__ it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? __eou__ just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . __eou__ I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . __eou__ shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ that depends . What is it ? __eou__ it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans __eou__ I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . __eou__ let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__ how about at 6 pm ? __eou__ see you then !
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know .

I think things are worked out just fine .
Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? __eou__ It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . __eou__ I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? __eou__ She made another white crack about my clothes . __eou__ Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? __eou__ Of course , I am sure . __eou__ You shall go easy on her . she is new here . __eou__ Just how am I supposed to do that ? __eou__ You shall just take it in surprise . __eou__ I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . __eou__ Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? __eou__ I am not . she is no picnic . __eou__ Well . if you think I can help , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , Serena .

While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__ That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__ I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__ 800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__ My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America .

Did you watch television last night , Charles ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ It was a good game , wasn't it ? __eou__ Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . __eou__ What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__ How did it finish ? __eou__ It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? __eou__ It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . __eou__ Did your wife enjoy it ? __eou__ No , she didn't .

I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . __eou__ now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . __eou__ what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . __eou__ well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__ that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__ then , you're probably addicted .

Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . __eou__ do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? __eou__ yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . __eou__ now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information .

If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__ Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__ What would you do ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__ One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__ Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__ As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__ What would you do after that ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know .

He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? __eou__ indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs .

She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__ and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__ crazy !
Good evening , John . __eou__ Good evening , Mary . __eou__ How are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? __eou__ Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date . __eou__ I'll call you . __eou__ All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch . __eou__ Have a great day , take care , bye .
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool .
have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? __eou__ yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__ what ? __eou__ I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__ well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ Oh , I'm shocked .
How are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi __eou__ Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ How are they at swimming ? __eou__ They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further .
how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ? __eou__ well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . __eou__ what do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about __eou__ how do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle __eou__ That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss .
I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . __eou__ Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__ So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . __eou__ I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon . __eou__ We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . __eou__ If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either . __eou__ I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__ The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable .
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job .
What are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . __eou__ Does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ What are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an __eou__ Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine __eou__ Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . __eou__ I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies .
I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . __eou__ I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ Can you ride a horse ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? __eou__ I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ What a good idea !
What's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . __eou__ The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . __eou__ What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? __eou__ We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . __eou__ Have you ever had snow in your city ? __eou__ My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . __eou__ The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny .
Which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ Isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there .
We've got a new manager in our department . __eou__ Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? __eou__ Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too __eou__ Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__ Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__ You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__ Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__ What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__ A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__ You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__ It's possible , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? __eou__ Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . __eou__ Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? __eou__ I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! __eou__ Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! __eou__ Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company .
I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . __eou__ I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life .
do you believe in UFO's ? __eou__ sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__ I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ I think there must be . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__ do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ no , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ I suppose you're right . __eou__ I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? __eou__ there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon .
You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . __eou__ Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed .
I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . __eou__ Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! __eou__ That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . __eou__ Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m with you on that .
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? __eou__ Take it easy . I have to cut my losses .
Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest . __eou__ Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ? __eou__ Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now . __eou__ Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in .
I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home . __eou__ Thank you all the same .
I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ? __eou__ You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall .

Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? __eou__ You got me on that one .
Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . __eou__ He is the guy I was telling you about .
Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? __eou__ I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . __eou__ I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? __eou__ That must be Conrad Reeves . __eou__ Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? __eou__ No , He must be her fourth or fifth . __eou__ Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! __eou__ She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . __eou__ I ’ m sure she is . __eou__ She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . __eou__ That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself .
Where do you come from ? __eou__ I come from England . __eou__ What's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East .

What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . __eou__ What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__ I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__ Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__ Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__ I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? __eou__ Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring __eou__ I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__ That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters .

Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Harry ? __eou__ We may go abroad . I ’ m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ’ d like to go there , too . We can ’ t make up our minds . __eou__ Will you travel by sea or by air ? __eou__ We may travel by sea . __eou__ It ’ s cheaper , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time . __eou__ I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves . __eou__ Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t

Mom , I didn ’ t have breast . I could eat a horse . __eou__ Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can .
Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers .
Did you order the cake ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot . __eou__ Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” __eou__ I ’ m on it !
What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? __eou__ Probably nothing . __eou__ You have to do something romantic . __eou__ Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means . __eou__ Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__ Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone .
what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . __eou__ you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! __eou__ doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? __eou__ well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . __eou__ did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? __eou__ no , I prefer to play with people I know . __eou__ how about mah-jong ? __eou__ it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . __eou__ I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ Thanks ! We love it . __eou__ Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . __eou__ I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it !
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? __eou__ yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? __eou__ I was at home with my parents in New York City . __eou__ really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? __eou__ I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . __eou__ that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? __eou__ no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . __eou__ did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? __eou__ yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . __eou__ did he survive ? __eou__ unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . __eou__ I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . __eou__ it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . __eou__ terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .
have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__ I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ that sure didn't last long !
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !
do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? __eou__ not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? __eou__ have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? __eou__ yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? __eou__ that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? __eou__ to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__ what do you have in mind ? __eou__ I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? __eou__ yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? __eou__ Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . __eou__ that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? __eou__ it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__ great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? __eou__ sounds good . I'll see you then !
so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? __eou__ yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ that's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__ yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? __eou__ I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ no . did you ? __eou__ yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__ that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__ I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__ actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too !
are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ it wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ it does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ if I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
Do you have any more questions ? __eou__ No , sir . __eou__ Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . __eou__ Good-bye , sir

Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr.Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening.Where do you think I should take them ? __eou__ Well , Mr.Li has very good taste in wine , and Galp is one of the biggest clients . I suggest you take them to a decent French restaurant . Make sure you make a very good impression . __eou__ That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ? __eou__ Or Lapis . They are both listed this year glory magazine for have most of frantic Fetch cuisine in town . But I heard Lapis has a better wine selection . __eou__ We'll go to the place . Could you book a table for 4 at 7 PM ? __eou__ Sure .
How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . __eou__ Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it .

They live with my brother now . and yours ? __eou__ My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? __eou__ No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? __eou__ I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . __eou__ How long have you been married ? __eou__ About seven years now . and you ? __eou__ I ‘ Ve been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? __eou__ It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? __eou__ If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . __eou__ If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__ ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__ Of course not !

I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ what did you argue about ? __eou__ he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__ yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . __eou__ well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r __eou__ no , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . __eou__ of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? __eou__ I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . __eou__ I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . __eou__ you can find out from their friends . __eou__ if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . __eou__ oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . __eou__ sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . __eou__ it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? __eou__ maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends .
Do you like Barry ? __eou__ No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest . __eou__ I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . __eou__ Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__ What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__ You're right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__ So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__ Of course !
that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__ yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__ Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . __eou__ I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ that ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks and I prepared ? __eou__ very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__ all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up .
so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ? __eou__ well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! __eou__ so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? __eou__ yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on __eou__ what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . __eou__ that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . __eou__ are the rooms nice and bright ? __eou__ yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . __eou__ do you have a balcony ? __eou__ no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . __eou__ you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? __eou__ it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo
so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b __eou__ that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help __eou__ so , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with is ? __eou__ she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year
good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? __eou__ yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . __eou__ certainly . For how many people ? __eou__ we ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? __eou__ I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? __eou__ about 7:30 . __eou__ yes .

My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7:30 on Friday . __eou__ yes .

You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! __eou__ Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . __eou__ They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . __eou__ They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .
John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ’ Ve got some good news ! __eou__ Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning . __eou__ I am . Don ’ t worry about getting your wallet . It ’ s my treat . __eou__ This is a first ! You must have won the lottery .

Do you get a good knowledge of China ? __eou__ Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . __eou__ All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . __eou__ Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . __eou__ No , before the In dynasty . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . __eou__ Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . __eou__ Yeah , many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China , I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them . __eou__ Do you like the Chinese traditional silk ? __eou__ I heard about it , but I don't have any clothes made from silk . __eou__ Go and pick some stuff up . The price can always surprise foreign friends . __eou__ Oh , I'm eager to have a try .
Where are we going now ? __eou__ We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park . __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing . __eou__ What can we see in it ? __eou__ Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . __eou__ Tragedy . __eou__ Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park .
Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ The stone is a prehistoric log . It was turned to stone millions of years ago . __eou__ Really ? It's unbelievable . __eou__ But it's the truth . __eou__ Do you have Ginkgo trees here ? __eou__ We don't have them here , I'm afraid . Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather . __eou__ What are these trees opposite to the pine trees ? __eou__ They are poplar trees . They are widely used in our lives . __eou__ I think I know that .

John , I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year . __eou__ I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend , Mark . __eou__ What are you talking about ? __eou__ What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? __eou__ You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! __eou__ Really ? Who made that rule up ? __eou__ With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . __eou__ That works for me !
Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John . __eou__ I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? __eou__ You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? __eou__ We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__ I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before .

Hey Joe , how have you been ? __eou__ I am doing well . How about you , Mary ? __eou__ I am doing OK , Joe . __eou__ There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ? __eou__ I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her . __eou__ I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ? __eou__ Did you have a certain movie in mind ? __eou__ I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . __eou__ I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” __eou__ Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie !

Let's do it . __eou__ I'll see you tomorrow then . __eou__ See you then . Goodbye .
Hi , how are you . Is Alice there ? __eou__ Speaking . What's up ? __eou__ Why haven't you answered the phone ? __eou__ My bad , I had chores to do . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__ What was the reason for your call ? __eou__ I want to do something tomorrow with you . __eou__ Sounds good . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I was thinking about seeing a movie . __eou__ Okay , let's go see a movie . __eou__ Until then . __eou__ Talk to you later .
Is Alice available ? __eou__ You're talking to her . __eou__ I've called you a hundred times today . __eou__ I was busy doing something . I apologize . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Did you need something ? __eou__ Did you want to do something tomorrow ? __eou__ Is there somewhere special you wanted to go ? __eou__ How about a movie ? __eou__ A movie sounds good . __eou__ Call me tomorrow then . __eou__ I will see you tomorrow .
It doesn't look very nice outside today . __eou__ You're right . I think it's going to rain later . __eou__ In the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining . __eou__ That wouldn't seem right . __eou__ Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird . __eou__ Exactly , it wouldn't be nice if it started raining . It's too hot . __eou__ I know , you're absolutely right . __eou__ I wish it would cool off one day . __eou__ That's how I feel , I want winter to come soon . __eou__ I enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes . __eou__ I know what you mean , but I'd rather be cold than hot . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel .
I wish it was a nicer day today . __eou__ That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . __eou__ It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . __eou__ It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . __eou__ It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . __eou__ Any rain right now would be pointless . __eou__ That's right , it really would be . __eou__ I want it to cool down some . __eou__ I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . __eou__ Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . __eou__ I would rather deal with the winter than the summer . __eou__ I feel the same way .
Did you hear the good news ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__ I got a promotion at my job . __eou__ Did you really ? __eou__ Seriously , I am so excited . __eou__ Well , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I'm so happy for you . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . You really deserved this . __eou__ You think so ? __eou__ Yes . Good for you .
Have you gone to school today ? __eou__ I went to school today . Did you go to school ? __eou__ I couldn't go to school today , I was sick . __eou__ That's horrible . I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class . __eou__ Thank you very much , that's kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__ When you miss a day of school , I'll be happy to give you the English assignments . __eou__ That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow .
Have you heard my good news ? __eou__ You haven't told me anything yet . __eou__ I got a promotion at work earlier this week . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ It's the truth . I am really happy . __eou__ Congratulations on your promotion . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ I am really excited for you . __eou__ Are you really ? __eou__ I'm serious . You deserved this promotion . __eou__ Is that what you really think ? __eou__ Yes , I do .
Did you hear the news ? __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week . __eou__ She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ? __eou__ I would've thought that somebody would have told you . __eou__ No , I had no idea . __eou__ Well , she did , her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . __eou__ Oh my God , that's great ! __eou__ Are you going to go and visit her and the baby ? __eou__ I think that I might . __eou__ Good ! I just thought I'd let you know . __eou__ Thanks for telling me .
Have you heard the news ? __eou__ I haven't heard anything . __eou__ Deborah had her baby last week . __eou__ Nobody told me . __eou__ I thought you heard . __eou__ I really wasn't told anything . __eou__ She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . __eou__ Wow , how exciting . __eou__ I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . __eou__ Of course I will . __eou__ I just wanted to let you know what happened . __eou__ I appreciate that .
What a wonderful dinner ! __eou__ Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it . __eou__ Where did you get your fantastic recipes ? __eou__ I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me . __eou__ I especially like the wonderful chicken dish . __eou__ That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish . __eou__ Is that shrimp in the soup ? __eou__ Yes , do you like it ? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables . __eou__ I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal . __eou__ Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal .
Hey George , how is your chicken ? __eou__ My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ? __eou__ My fish is pretty dry too . __eou__ It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . __eou__ Yes , it seems that way to me also . __eou__ How are your vegetables ? __eou__ My vegetables are very soggy . __eou__ Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . __eou__ I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter . __eou__ I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food .
George , is your chicken OK ? __eou__ It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ? __eou__ My fish is very dry . __eou__ I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . __eou__ That's exactly what I was thinking had happened . __eou__ Are your vegetables OK ? __eou__ The vegetables are kind of mushy . __eou__ So are mine . I think they left them cooking too long . __eou__ The food here is usually good , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem . __eou__ I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something .
This is a great meal ! __eou__ Thank you . I am glad that everything turned out so well . __eou__ Who taught you how to cook this well ? __eou__ I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute . __eou__ Wow , what is in this chicken dish ? __eou__ Isn't that great ? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice . __eou__ Is the soup a shrimp soup ? __eou__ Yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . __eou__ I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal . __eou__ I appreciate you bringing the wine . It goes well with the chicken .
I really love this meal . __eou__ Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . __eou__ Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? __eou__ I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . __eou__ The chicken is out of this world ! __eou__ I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . __eou__ I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . __eou__ Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . __eou__ It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . __eou__ I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken .
Do you want some dessert ? __eou__ No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Where is our waitress anyway ? __eou__ Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? __eou__ I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . __eou__ Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . __eou__ So the bill is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . __eou__ I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__ Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__ I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip .
Does your chicken taste all right ? __eou__ The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ? __eou__ My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . __eou__ It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . __eou__ Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . __eou__ Are your vegetables a little mushy ? __eou__ The vegetables seem to not be very fresh . __eou__ Mine aren't so good , either . __eou__ I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . __eou__ I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem .
You look really nice today . __eou__ Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day . __eou__ Really , where did you get it ? __eou__ I got it from Macy's . __eou__ It's really nice . __eou__ Thanks again . You look nice today , too . __eou__ Thank you . I just got these shoes today . __eou__ Really ? What kind of shoes are they ? __eou__ These are called All Star Chuck Taylors . __eou__ I really like those . How much did they cost ? __eou__ They were about forty dollars . __eou__ I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair .
Have you met the new girl ? __eou__ No . Have you ? __eou__ She's one of the prettiest girls at the school . __eou__ What does she look like ? __eou__ Well , she's quite short . __eou__ How tall would you say that she is ? __eou__ I would say she's only 5 feet . __eou__ What about her facial features ? __eou__ She has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful . __eou__ I think I know who you're talking about . __eou__ Have you seen her ? __eou__ I think that I have .
Would you like to order anything else ? __eou__ No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . __eou__ Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ? __eou__ I think that is our waitress is over by the bar . Boy , the service has not been good this evening . __eou__ She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check . __eou__ Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together . __eou__ Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__ What do you think would be the right amount to tip ? __eou__ I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . __eou__ I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . __eou__ I believe that 10 % is just about right amount . __eou__ I think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave .
I absolutely love what you're wearing today . __eou__ You do ? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago . __eou__ Seriously , it looks really nice on you . Where did you buy it from ? __eou__ I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall . __eou__ I really like that outfit . __eou__ Thanks . I think you look nice today , too . __eou__ Thank you . I just bought these new shoes earlier today . __eou__ Those are nice . What are they ? __eou__ These are some Chucks . __eou__ Those are great . How much were they ? __eou__ I got them for forty . __eou__ I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks .
Did you go to school today ? __eou__ Of course . Did you ? __eou__ I didn't want to , so I didn't . __eou__ That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ? __eou__ That's a switch . __eou__ I'm serious , have you ? __eou__ No , I haven't . Why ? __eou__ I really want to go to the movies this weekend . __eou__ So go then . __eou__ I really don't want to go by myself . __eou__ Well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ? __eou__ No , I think I'm going to go to the movies .
Did you make it to school today ? __eou__ I always do . Did you go to school today ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? __eou__ That was an odd change of subject . __eou__ Maybe it was , but answer the question . __eou__ No , not recently . __eou__ I want to go to see a movie this weekend . __eou__ What's stopping you then ? __eou__ I don't want to go alone . __eou__ So , will you be at school tomorrow ? __eou__ No , I want to go to the movies instead .
Did you even bother to go to school today ? __eou__ Yeah , I went . Did you go ? __eou__ No , I didn't feel like it . __eou__ That's nice , have you been to the movies lately ? __eou__ No , but that was a random change of subject . __eou__ It may have been random , but have you ? __eou__ I haven't lately . __eou__ I would love to catch a movie this weekend . __eou__ So then , why don't you just go ? __eou__ I don't want to see a movie by myself . __eou__ Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ? __eou__ I think I might just go to the movies .
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__ Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . __eou__ Sure . Meet me at five .
My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? __eou__ Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__ Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , I appreciate that !
All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . __eou__ Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . __eou__ That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday . __eou__ Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly .
Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I ’ ll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . __eou__ Sure , I ’ m heading out myself . Enjoy your evening . __eou__ Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . __eou__ Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow !
Have you met the new manager in customer service ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ? __eou__ She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy ! __eou__ You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did .
You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking . __eou__ Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager . __eou__ I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years .
Would you like to order anything else ? __eou__ No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . __eou__ The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak . __eou__ I have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional . __eou__ Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience . __eou__ Let's take a look at our bill . The total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much money should we leave for a tip ? __eou__ I know that 15 % is a normal tip , but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . What do you think about tipping her 20 % ? __eou__ She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip . __eou__ So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , what a wonderful meal ! __eou__ It absolutely was a great meal . We'll have to return here for lunch sometime .
Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages ! __eou__ I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ? __eou__ Oh , fine . Hey , why don ’ t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? __eou__ Yeah , why not ? I ’ Ve got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ?
Martin . __eou__ Hi . John , it ’ s Emily . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Great , thanks . What ’ s up ? __eou__ Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ?
Do you want some dessert ? __eou__ No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Oh , here comes our waitress with our check . __eou__ The service here has been really great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , the service was quite good . __eou__ So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . __eou__ I agree that 20 % would be just about right . __eou__ OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , what a nice dinner that was ! __eou__ We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .
One Grand Slam breakfast for you ! __eou__ Thanks . You know , I just noticed that these eggs are fried , and I ordered scrambled . __eou__ Thank you for pointing that out . I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast . __eou__ Not a problem . I can just trade my plate with his . __eou__ A special order of banana pancakes for you ! __eou__ Pancakes ? I don't like pancakes . I ordered waffles . __eou__ I am so sorry , madam ! __eou__ I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles . __eou__ I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now . __eou__ That would take care of it , thank you .

Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two .
Hey , Devi , have you thought about where would you like to go to dinner on Friday for your birthday ? __eou__ I am not sure . I don't know that many restaurants around here . __eou__ You know , we could look online at the local Internet sites . __eou__ Good . Let's take a look ! __eou__ What kind of food would you like ? __eou__ I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best . __eou__ This one , Shogun , looks good . __eou__ Oh yes , I've heard of that one . Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great ! __eou__ Would you like to go there then ? __eou__ I think that that would be a really good choice ! Let's call and make a reservation .
Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . __eou__ I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . __eou__ Where were you ? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding .
I ’ m really glad I got a chance to talk to you before you left , Mary . Have a safe trip ! __eou__ Thanks . Try not to work too hard while I ’ m away ! __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll try not to ! See you after Christmas . __eou__ Okay-bye ! Have a nice Christmas .
Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ? __eou__ I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant . __eou__ There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper . __eou__ OK , we could look at that . __eou__ Do you have a particular type of food that you would like ? __eou__ I really like Japanese or Thai food . __eou__ That Japanese restaurant , Shogun , got good reviews . __eou__ Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it ! __eou__ Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday ? __eou__ That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ?
Well , I guess that ’ s about it . Everything ’ s packed and ready to go . __eou__ It ’ s hard to believer you ’ re really retiring . What are you going to do with yourself ? __eou__ Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . __eou__ Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are .
Hello , Mr . Macmillan . __eou__ Hi , Susan . How are you feeling today ? __eou__ Much better , thanks . __eou__ Glad to hear it .
Did you enjoy the restaurant ? __eou__ I didn't really like it all that much . __eou__ What do you think the problem was ? __eou__ Well , they are pretty new .

There's been a dramatic change in the weather pattern . __eou__ Don't tell me it affects our flight . __eou__ It has been delayed . __eou__ Did they say for how long ? __eou__ No , but probably until there is a break in the storm . __eou__ So we can't really go anywhere , can we ? __eou__ I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates . __eou__ I brought some cards . Are you up for a long game ?
We are on our way . I think our first stop is Buckingham Palace . __eou__ That's right . I can already see the Palace Garden on the left . __eou__ And here is Buckingham Palace !

I think we will be able to go inside . __eou__ This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ? __eou__ I guess we should see Big Ben soon . __eou__ Yes . It is just round the corner . Oh , can you see the London Eye ? Look straight and to your right . __eou__ Look at this bridge . We will soon be crossing the Thames . __eou__ This is Lambeth Bridge . We will then loop back and cross the river again on Westminster Bridge . __eou__ Wonderful .

I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins . __eou__ Yeah . You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes . __eou__ Ah , where can I find old paper money and coins used before and after 1949 ? __eou__ I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable . __eou__ Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss . __eou__ You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside .

Which seats do you prefer , cushioned seats , ordinary seats , cushioned berth , or ordinary berth ? __eou__ In a cushioned sleeper , please .

Do you have anything recommended ? __eou__ OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . __eou__ Hey , How did you know I came from America ? __eou__ Just a hunch , sir . __eou__ How much again ? __eou__ $ 59.95 . __eou__ That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . __eou__ Sorry , sir . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . __eou__ Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . __eou__ That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . __eou__ DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml . __eou__ It's $ 60 here . __eou__ That's very unbelievable .

It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . __eou__ OK , can you name the items in it ? __eou__ Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . __eou__ OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now . __eou__ Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible .
Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . __eou__ Where else haven't I been to yet ? __eou__ Not many but these ones . They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls ! __eou__ Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ? __eou__ Well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections . __eou__ Private collectors ! Oh , they must have excellent collections . I'll go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , David , don't keep me in suspense ! __eou__ No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . __eou__ Enough , David ! I can't wait anymore . Let's go right now ! __eou__ Okey , Okey . We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House , a multi-folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there . __eou__ Very interesting . That's really a place I must go and see . And then ? __eou__ If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . __eou__ Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say .
Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . __eou__ Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__ what's interesting to see there ? __eou__ Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__ I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__ Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__ It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__ Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo .
Where do you want to go this weekend ? __eou__ Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . __eou__ Do you want to take the jet ski ? __eou__ Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Renting is good ! __eou__ Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? __eou__ Okay , you call them . __eou__ Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear .
Excuse me , is this the Guyon Travel Agency ? __eou__ Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to travel to the ancient town in the south of China . Would you please tell me something about it ? __eou__ Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense . __eou__ Wonderful . That's just what I expect , where is my first place if I go there ? __eou__ Zhouzhuang . __eou__ How long does the tour take ? __eou__ It's about two days . __eou__ what's the cost ? __eou__ It's about 300 yuan . __eou__ I know . Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right . May you have a good trip ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ My pleasure .
What a wonderful sight ! __eou__ Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax . __eou__ We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place . __eou__ I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible . __eou__ So would I . Look , it might be going to rain . __eou__ I don't think it will spoil our trip . __eou__ It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . __eou__ Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads . __eou__ That's a good idea !
Excuse me , are cameras allowed here ? __eou__ Sorry , sir , in order to protect these paintings , taking photos are strictly forbidden here . __eou__ I see . What a pity . I have to appreciate it carefully . __eou__ I am really sorry for that .

How many what ? __eou__ How many people are you paying the tax for ? __eou__ My wife and me . The two of us . __eou__ 100 yuan each , so you owe me 200 yuan . __eou__ Oh , OK . Here's 200 yuan . __eou__ Here are your two receipts . __eou__ Thanks . What shall I do then ? __eou__ Just give these receipts to the lady at the door to immigration . Don't worry , she'll ask for them from you . __eou__ Oh , I guess I'm a little confused . __eou__ We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip . __eou__ Thanks a lot .

Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? __eou__ Of course ! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail .

Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities . __eou__ I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . __eou__ Do they have a swimming pool ? __eou__ No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . __eou__ What ’ s the service like ? __eou__ It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . __eou__ It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? __eou__ There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . __eou__ I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . __eou__ Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . __eou__ Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? __eou__ No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . __eou__ One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . __eou__ I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff .
Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . __eou__ Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__ The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__ What kind of documents did you need to present ? __eou__ I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . __eou__ Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? __eou__ I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . __eou__ Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? __eou__ That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions .

Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . __eou__ Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! __eou__ I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__ Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg !

Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? __eou__ Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . __eou__ His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? __eou__ Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts .

You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa . __eou__ Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time .

What a nice day ! __eou__ Yes .

I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__ Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__ Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year .

But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__ Oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air . __eou__ Wonderful ! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! __eou__ Tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? __eou__ Perfect . I'II start preparing tomorrow . If we re going to drive , l'II need to fill up the tank . __eou__ No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__ We can take the train , that will be faster . I'II book the tickets tomorrow morning . __eou__ Great !

Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . __eou__ I feel kind of stupid . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . __eou__ You got lost . You're kidding ! __eou__ No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__ You could have called . __eou__ I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__ You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__ Guess where we ended up . __eou__ I don't know . Where ? __eou__ When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . __eou__ Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__ I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__ Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__ I know it is . I don't know how it happened . __eou__ Hmm , maybe I do . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Maybe I have an idea how it happened . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__ Oh , that's what you think , huh ? __eou__ Yes , that's what I think.Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries , you'll get lost for even longer.Maybe six hours or so . __eou__ You know what , Trish ? __eou__ I hope so . I really hope so . __eou__ Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . __eou__ No , I wasn't . It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel .
Do you think we can get to the airport by 8 __eou__ We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic . __eou__ Is it the rush hour now ? __eou__ Yes , but don't worry . We'll make it .
You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? __eou__ In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone . __eou__ You are not going to give it up , are you ? __eou__ No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__ I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__ Yes , but whom to ? __eou__ Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . __eou__ That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__ Tell you what , I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I ’ ll mention it to him then . __eou__ Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .
I need to know why I'm being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . __eou__ Hmm . Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night . __eou__ Monday night ? Monday night I was at a great concert . __eou__ Well , as they say , garbage in , garbage out . Let me correct this error , please . __eou__ Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly . __eou__ When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge . __eou__ Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? __eou__ Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 . __eou__ Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? __eou__ Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not .
Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to ? __eou__ Of course ! How much would you like to spend on your meal ? __eou__ My date is quite sophisticated . She would expect nothing less than the best . __eou__ Well , how about our own hotel restaurant ? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating . __eou__ That's a good idea , except I want to go out , not stay in . Something else , maybe ? __eou__ Well , how about Gramercy Tavern ? It's a very popular tourist spot , with great food and music . __eou__ That sounds good ! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation ? __eou__ Of course , sir . You've made a good choice .
I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan . __eou__ Certainly ! How much are you planning to spend on dinner , sir ? __eou__ My date's very sophisticated , so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best . __eou__ May I suggest our own hotel restaurant ? It got three stars in the latest restaurant review . __eou__ No , thank you , I want to go out on the town . What other ideas do you have ? __eou__ There's always Gramercy Tavern . They have live jazz . The food is delicious , but very expensive . __eou__ That sounds like a good place to take a date . Can you make a reservation for me ? __eou__ As you wish , sir . You'll have a wonderful time there .
Could I order dinner ? __eou__ Of course . What would you like ? __eou__ I want a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . __eou__ I'm so sorry . We ran out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? __eou__ That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay . __eou__ May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__ Not tonight , thank you . __eou__ No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay . __eou__ Charge it to whatever account you like . __eou__ Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready . Enjoy !
Hi , I need broadband for my computer . __eou__ No problem . Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you're good to go . __eou__ That's a problem .

Could you bring me some food , please ? __eou__ Sure . What do you fancy ? __eou__ Can I have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ? __eou__ Sir , the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out .

Okay , porterhouse will be fine then . __eou__ Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__ Not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion . __eou__ Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Your food will be brought to you momentarily . I hope you enjoy it .

I can tell you about some alternatives we have . __eou__ Any alternative that works will be great . __eou__ Well , there's our computer lab on the first floor . __eou__ That sounds good . What's the charge ? __eou__ The lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print . __eou__ That sounds good .

Now , if I need to print something there ? __eou__ They plan to install a printer here . But until then , you'll have to use the lab .
Hi . I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup . __eou__ Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running . __eou__ That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only . __eou__ In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives . __eou__ Anything to get me up and running . __eou__ For starters , we have a computer lab . __eou__ Fantastic !

I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? __eou__ Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs .
I need something to eat , please . __eou__ Tell me what you're hungry for . __eou__ I feel like champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . __eou__ Unfortunately , we're out of filet mignon at the moment . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? __eou__ Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too . __eou__ Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? __eou__ Just the champagne will be fine , thank you . __eou__ You'll see this charge on your amenities account . __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ It won't be long until your food is delivered .

Yes , I need more amenities . __eou__ By amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ? __eou__ You know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo . __eou__ Okay , I got it . You've already run out of all your amenities ? __eou__ No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . __eou__ I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? __eou__ I need to take home some souvenirs ! __eou__ Okay , finally I understand . You would like souvenirs ! __eou__ Yes , souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection . __eou__ If it's souvenirs you want , sir , just visit our souvenir shop .

I need some more amenities , please . __eou__ I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . __eou__ Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . __eou__ Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? __eou__ No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . __eou__ I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ? __eou__ What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? __eou__ Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs ! __eou__ There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs . __eou__ Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ?

Is there a charge ? __eou__ It's ten cents a copy , sir . __eou__ Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it . __eou__ A dime is still a bargain , sir .
Hi , can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now ? __eou__ Sir , you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab . __eou__ That's great . I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests ? __eou__ Sir , each copy is ten cents or one dime , whichever you prefer . __eou__ In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy .

I am checking out . Here is the key to my room . __eou__ Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go ! __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ If you don't mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel ? __eou__ This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful . __eou__ That's very honest of you . Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time .
Hi , I'm out of here . Here's my key . __eou__ Give me just a few seconds , sir , and I'll hand you your receipt . Here you are . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir . __eou__ I only had nine little problems here .

I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible . __eou__ No problem , sir . There's a copy machine in our computer lab . __eou__ Very good . How much does each copy cost ? __eou__ Each copy will cost you a dime , sir . __eou__ A dime ?

My stay is over . Here's the key to my room . __eou__ Thank you . And here's your receipt , sir . __eou__ Many thanks . __eou__ I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . __eou__ This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . __eou__ I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit . Please have a pleasant trip home .
My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . __eou__ Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' __eou__ That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . __eou__ Okay , let me see what I can do for you . __eou__ Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple . __eou__ I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service . __eou__ Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? __eou__ Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . __eou__ This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters .
I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ? __eou__ But of course ! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner ? __eou__ She deserves nothing but the best , of course . __eou__ In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . __eou__ I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant . Do you have another one in mind ? __eou__ You can always go to Gramercy Tavern . It's quite popular , despite its expensive entrees . __eou__ Great food and lots of patrons ? What more could I want ? Please reserve a table for me . __eou__ Yes , sir . You're going to have a great time .
I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . __eou__ Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . __eou__ That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . __eou__ Okay , sir , bear with me a moment . __eou__ Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word . __eou__ One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file . __eou__ You can __eou__ I feel your pain , sir . __eou__ Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . __eou__ I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here .
So , now I need your help again , if you don't mind . I'm taking a date to a restaurant . __eou__ I'd love to help you ! What is your budget for the dinner ? __eou__ She strikes me as being very sophisticated . Only the best will do for her . __eou__ Well , what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant ? It is very upscale , with a three-star rating . __eou__ I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ? __eou__ The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated . It has great food and live jazz , but it's not cheap . __eou__ Yes , that sounds like a winner . Would you please call them to reserve a table ? __eou__ I'm already dialing , sir .
I'm taking my date to a restaurant . Could you tell me about one or two good ones ? __eou__ My pleasure ! How much would you like to spend on your date ? __eou__ She will want an excellent restaurant , of course . __eou__ You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris . The service and food are world-class . __eou__ I wanted to go out somewhere , not stay here . Do you know of another good restaurant ? __eou__ You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern . It's famous for its food , service , and live jazz . __eou__ I like that ! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ? __eou__ At once , sir . You'll love this place , I assure you .
Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? __eou__ Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' __eou__ Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . __eou__ Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . __eou__ Thank you for taking care of it so quickly . __eou__ Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge . __eou__ You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! __eou__ Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir . __eou__ Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! __eou__ I don't blame you , sir . Two dollars is a lot of money .
Well , I've got a date . Now I need to find a restaurant . Can you help me ? __eou__ No problem , of course ! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady ? __eou__ Nothing but the best for a pretty woman ! __eou__ Sir , the restaurant you seek is right here . This hotel has a three-star restaurant . __eou__ Well , I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town . Do you have another suggestion ? __eou__ Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant . Plus , they have live jazz . __eou__ Gramercy Tavern , eh ? I think I've heard of that before . Call to get us a table , okay ? __eou__ Right away , sir . She will be impressed with your local knowledge .
I'm checking out in about half an hour . __eou__ Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir . __eou__ Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__ You're right . It's only 9 __eou__ Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags . __eou__ Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit . __eou__ My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ? __eou__ Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though . __eou__ Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment . __eou__ Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour .
Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes ? __eou__ Just say the word , sir . __eou__ Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . __eou__ I agree . The dew is still on the grass . __eou__ I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage . __eou__ We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit . __eou__ Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ? __eou__ Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit . __eou__ Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second . __eou__ Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away .
In case you didn't know , I'm checking out in half an hour . __eou__ That won't be a problem , sir . __eou__ That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me . __eou__ You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you . __eou__ I still have time to explore more of New York , but I need a place to secure my baggage . __eou__ We have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit . __eou__ A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit . __eou__ Just present your VISA card , and there won't be any problems . __eou__ That deposit bothers me . Give me a minute . __eou__ Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time .
I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes . __eou__ Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you . __eou__ Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__ There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . __eou__ What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ? __eou__ You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . __eou__ Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? __eou__ I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card . __eou__ It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . __eou__ Don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out .
I need to get a taxi . __eou__ We have a variety of transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ? __eou__ No , that won't be necessary . I just need a taxi . __eou__ Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine . That's such a stylish way to travel . __eou__ Just a taxi , please . __eou__ And what is your destination ? __eou__ I'm going to Rockefeller Center . __eou__ I see . What time do you want to depart from the hotel ? __eou__ I want to leave as soon as possible . __eou__ Okay , a taxi will arrive in seconds , sir . __eou__ Thank you , I'm coming down now . __eou__ It won't be but a few seconds , sir .
I'm going to need a taxi . __eou__ You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi . We can offer you a private vehicle . __eou__ A private vehicle , huh ? No , a taxi is okay . __eou__ Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi . __eou__ No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo . __eou__ No upgrade of any kind . And where might you be going ? __eou__ I'm headed to Rockefeller Center . __eou__ When shall I tell the taxi to be here ? __eou__ Right now . __eou__ The taxi will be here immediately , sir . __eou__ Good , I'm leaving my room in about one minute . __eou__ You won't have to wait a second , sir .
Can you get me a taxi ? __eou__ We offer various types of transportation . Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle ? __eou__ Thanks , but no thanks . A taxi will do just fine . __eou__ In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . __eou__ No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers . __eou__ Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ? __eou__ My destination is Rockefeller Center . __eou__ What time do you want to leave the hotel ? __eou__ As soon as possible . __eou__ I'll call the taxi immediately , sir . __eou__ Okay , I'm coming downstairs now . __eou__ A brand new taxi is pulling up now .
Could you please reserve a taxi for me ? __eou__ Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking ? __eou__ A private vehicle ? No , thanks , I won't need one . __eou__ Even better than a private vehicle is a limo . How does that sound ? __eou__ T A X I , please . __eou__ A taxi it is . Where will you be headed ? __eou__ Rockefeller Center . Can you get the taxi here immediately , please ? __eou__ A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir . __eou__ Good . I'll get my coat and come downstairs . __eou__ The taxi will be ready when you are , sir .
I need a taxi . __eou__ We could easily provide you with a private vehicle , if you'd prefer . __eou__ No , the taxi will do . __eou__ Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine . __eou__ No , thank you . Taxis and I get along just fine . __eou__ No private vehicle , no limo . Got it . Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center . __eou__ What time should the taxi be here to pick you up ? __eou__ I'm ready to go right now . __eou__ I'll have a taxi for you momentarily , sir . __eou__ Great ! As soon as I brush my teeth , I'll be downstairs . __eou__ You'll enjoy our new , clean taxis , sir .

We will have to confiscate these . __eou__ Confiscate ? __eou__ Yes , we will have to dispose of them . __eou__ It's too bad . They are very delicious . __eou__ I know .

Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . __eou__ Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . __eou__ How long does it take to get there ? __eou__ About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train .

Twelve hours is such a long time ! __eou__ Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times .

In a bus , all you see are the roads . __eou__ Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable . __eou__ I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . __eou__ Look at that village ! __eou__ Beautiful . __eou__ Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? __eou__ I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry .

Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger __eou__ Sounds good !

Some places aren't good to go.But I can show you the right bus to take . It will be no problem . __eou__ We want to see the Statue of Liberty too . __eou__ I have never done that myself . But I hear it is very interesting . You two should go . __eou__ You have never gone to the Statue of Liberty ? ! I can't believe it ! But you live here ! __eou__ Yes , but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . __eou__ I know . Are the subway trains easy to take here ?
It sure is hot . Why don't we go in the Haunted House ? At least it will be air conditioned . __eou__ I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! __eou__ Well . Maybe I'll go alone then . I really don't want to miss it . __eou__ Go alone if you want . I will wait at that cafe and have a soda . __eou__ It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know . __eou__ I know . But if you don't go in the Haunted House , you won't be happy.So I will wait for you . It's no problem . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ I'm sorry it took so long . __eou__ Don't worry about it . But how was it ?
I hope the food here is good . __eou__ Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . __eou__ But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star . __eou__ I think we might not see any . __eou__ Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ? __eou__ I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . __eou__ I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? __eou__ Yes , but I still think it could be better .
Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in . __eou__ No , I don't want to . __eou__ Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it . __eou__ Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ? __eou__ But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different . __eou__ Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world . __eou__ I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ? __eou__ Yes . That is something I will enjoy . __eou__ Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ? __eou__ We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like . __eou__ I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . __eou__ Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here . __eou__ Alright , let's go .
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to check in . __eou__ Do you have a reservation ? __eou__ Yes , my name is Carol Tiang . That's spelled J - I - A - N - G . __eou__ I'm sorry , Ma'am . I can't find anything under that name.Do you have your confirmation number ? __eou__ No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month . __eou__ Well , let me look again . How do you spell your first name , Ma'am ? __eou__ C - A - R - O - L . Carol . __eou__ I don't find a Carol in the computer for today . I have a Carol Larson here . But that reservation is for next Monday . __eou__ No , that's not me . My name is Tiang , not Larson . My husband reserved for me . __eou__ Are you sure he used your name , Ma'am ? Maybe he reserved under his name . __eou__ His name is Lin , L - I - N . __eou__ I'm sorry . I have nothing here . __eou__ Miss , I know he made this reservation for me .
I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip . __eou__ Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . __eou__ What would you like to do today ? __eou__ I really think we should take a tour of the White House . __eou__ I thought we could go to some of the museums.Don ' t you want to see the museums ? __eou__ Of course . But today I feel like seeing the White House.We should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . __eou__ I don't agree . I think the Capitol building is the most famous.But okay . If you want to see the White House , we'll go see it . I'm just afraid it will be boring . __eou__ Boring ? How can it be boring ? It sounds very interesting to me .
Excuse me , but I ’ m a bit lost here . Where does this street lead to ? __eou__ The Queen Street , I guess . __eou__ So is it the right way to the City Hall ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction .
But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . __eou__ No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . __eou__ Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . __eou__ I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__ So I can't take my gun then . __eou__ Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . __eou__ Yes , it's true I don't . __eou__ You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! __eou__ What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__ No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . __eou__ I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . __eou__ Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . __eou__ First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? __eou__ No , I'm fine .
Ladies and gentlemen , our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport . __eou__ Excuse me , Miss.What did the announcement say ? __eou__ We'll be delayed for one hour , because the airport is very crowded . __eou__ No kidding ! We'll miss the connecting flight . __eou__ Oh , will you ? That's too bad.We ' re very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble . __eou__ I really have to get to Paris by this evening.Would you please try to find any other available flight ?
Good morning . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . Do you have any seats available on a flight for Beijing leaving at 15 __eou__ Sure we do . First-class or economy ? __eou__ One economy , please .

I have a reservation for a single with a bath . __eou__ We're sorry , but single rooms have been occupied . __eou__ What's the room rate ?

Is the rate for a room only ? __eou__ No , sir.The tax is included .
Excuse me . Is this the right way to the museum ? __eou__ I'm afraid you're going in the opposite direction . Go back the way you came , and take the second turn on the left . The museum is straight ahead , right in front of you . __eou__ Will it take me long to get there ? __eou__ Well , it's about fifteen minutes ' walk . __eou__ Which bus goes there ? __eou__ You may take a No . 34 bus . And the subway can also take you there . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure .

Oh , I see.Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're quite welcome .
I can't get into my room . I mean I left my room key inside . __eou__ I see , sir.Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . __eou__ Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ? __eou__ I'm afraid we have no extra key.So I'll send somebody to your room . __eou__ By the way , what should I do with the key when I go out ? __eou__ Please drop it at the front desk when you leave tie hotel .
I am sorry to say this , but I seem to have lost the key to the safe . __eou__ Where do you think you lost it ?

Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . __eou__ Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky.Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ah . __eou__ Ahhhhhhhh __eou__ Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? __eou__ A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . __eou__ Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch o __eou__ Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo __eou__ Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! __eou__ Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . __eou__ Thanks doc , bye !
Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . __eou__ Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . __eou__ Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? __eou__ We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! __eou__ Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! __eou__ Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! __eou__ Is that why you missed work today ? __eou__ Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . __eou__ Www ! __eou__ I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! __eou__ Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . __eou__ Oh , yeah . I ’ m there !
Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . __eou__ Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . __eou__ Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__ No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax .
Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . __eou__ It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . __eou__ Yes , I need to refill it today . __eou__ Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__ I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__ Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__ Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__ But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__ Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__ But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__ A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__ Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__ Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__ This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__ Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? __eou__ I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . __eou__ Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? __eou__ I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . __eou__ Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! __eou__ Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath .
Doctor , can you give me some suggestions on how to stay healthy ? __eou__ Well , first of all , you need to make sure that you eat the right foods . __eou__ What are the best foods to eat ? __eou__ You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables , along with whole grains and protein . __eou__ What should I avoid ? __eou__ You need to avoid highly fatty and greasy foods . You should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine . __eou__ What else is important to stay healthy ? __eou__ You need to get plenty of exercise every day . If you smoke , you need to stop . __eou__ Is it OK to drink alcohol ? __eou__ Actually , studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don ’ t drink .

Did you take the job ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It involves a lot of travel .
I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? __eou__ Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? __eou__ I want to have a foot massage and a haircut . __eou__ A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . __eou__ Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures . __eou__ This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor ! __eou__ I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? __eou__ Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . __eou__ Maybe we should try a thai massage too . __eou__ What ’ s special about a thai massage ? __eou__ That ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet . __eou__ Sounds painful !
Look , Bob hasn't made any progress on that project . __eou__ I see what you mean . __eou__ We should have a word with him . __eou__ Let me handle it .

You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication . __eou__ Do I only need to take that one drug ? __eou__ I am going to add a second drug for now , Lisinopril , which is an ACE inhibitor . __eou__ What can I expect when I take that medication ? __eou__ You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough .
The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn . __eou__ Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . __eou__ What is this test for ? __eou__ Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count . __eou__ What does that tell him ? __eou__ Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection . __eou__ Will the blood test hurt ? __eou__ It is only a little pin stick . I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up . __eou__ Ouch ! __eou__ There we go ! I got the blood that I needed .
What about a medication to help me with my problem ? __eou__ There are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure . __eou__ What types of medications would be best ? __eou__ For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . __eou__ What are the side effects from taking that drug , __eou__ You need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . __eou__ Will that one medication take care of all of my problems ? __eou__ For now I want you to take a second drug , Lisinopril , an ACE inhibitor . __eou__ Am I going to experience any complications with that drug ? __eou__ The most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won ’ t experience anything negative .
My doctor says that I need a blood test . __eou__ I can help you with that . Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . __eou__ What are you taking my blood for ? __eou__ Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count . __eou__ What information does that give him ? __eou__ If your white blood cell count is off , it could signal an infection somewhere in your body . __eou__ Is a blood test painful ? __eou__ I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein . It will only feel like a little pin prick . __eou__ Oh , my God , that hurts ! __eou__ That was it ! Thank you for coming in today .
Have you been having any problems lately ? __eou__ No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked . __eou__ Do you have a history of high blood pressure ? __eou__ No , I have never been told that I have high blood pressure . __eou__ High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms . __eou__ How do you check for high blood pressure ? __eou__ We are going to use this cuff here , and it will give me a reading . __eou__ What do the numbers mean ? __eou__ They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood . __eou__ Good . That will help me know how I am doing .
I came to this lab to have my blood drawn . __eou__ You are in the right place . Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat . __eou__ What am I being tested for ? __eou__ Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is . __eou__ What does my white blood cell count tell him ? __eou__ Usually if your white count is off , the doctor suspects an infection . __eou__ How much will it hurt ? __eou__ It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find . __eou__ Is that my blood going into that tube ? __eou__ That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed . Thanks for coming in !
How have you been feeling lately ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately . __eou__ Has your blood pressure been high before ? __eou__ If I have high blood pressure , it is news to me . __eou__ Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer . __eou__ What do you use to check for high blood pressure ? __eou__ I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading . __eou__ What does the reading tell you ? __eou__ I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest . __eou__ I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy .
Hi , what brings you to my office today ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out . __eou__ Have you had the flu lately ? __eou__ No , I have been pretty healthy . I just have trouble taking a really deep breath . __eou__ Have you ever been tested for allergies ? __eou__ Peaches make me break out , but I don ’ t have any other allergies . __eou__ Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ? __eou__ I ’ Ve noticed that it is worse when I am under stress , like during finals week . __eou__ I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma . __eou__ I appreciate the referral , doctor .
Have you been feeling OK lately ? __eou__ My coach wants you to check my blood pressure . __eou__ Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure . __eou__ People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer . __eou__ What test do you do for high blood pressure ? __eou__ We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading . __eou__ When you get the reading , what information does it give you ? __eou__ It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest . __eou__ I am hoping that this test goes well for me .
Good morning , how have you been doing ? __eou__ I haven ’ t been able to take a deep breath lately , and I need to know why . __eou__ Have you had any type of bug lately ? __eou__ No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe . __eou__ Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ? __eou__ No one has ever checked me for allergies . __eou__ Does this happen more when you are under stress ? __eou__ When the weather gets really cold , it gets worse . __eou__ I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma . __eou__ Thank you for pursuing this . I appreciate your help .
What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ I am very active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done . __eou__ Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the happier I am . __eou__ Do you have any friend you would call really close ones ? __eou__ Yes , I would call three of my former classmates really close friends . We often get together and talk with each other . Whenever I counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand . __eou__ What kind of people would you like to work with ? __eou__ People who are honest , dedicated to their work and have integrity . __eou__ What kind of people you find hard to work with ? __eou__ Slacker and those who violate working principles .

Can you work over tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son . __eou__ Okay , I'll ask Bob to cover it . __eou__ Thanks . I appreciate it .
I thought about what you said . __eou__ And what did you decide ? __eou__ I decided that you're right . __eou__ I'm glad you saw the reason .
Hello , Bob . Can you give me an update of the situation ? __eou__ Mary's is handling it . __eou__ Is everything under control ? __eou__ Of course . Mary is our most experienced member .
Is it okay to have a day off next week ? __eou__ Why ? What's the problem ? __eou__ I need to go to the dentist . __eou__ Okay , I'll get Bob to cover you .
I'm going to let Bob know about the merger . __eou__ It makes no sense to tell him about that . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because he'll tell Mary and that will cause us problems .
I'm tired . __eou__ Okay , let's call it a day .
Bob was late for work this morning . __eou__ Has he been late before ? __eou__ Yes , once last week . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know .
Maybe you should have told me first ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because we're partners . __eou__ I realize that but I needed to make a decision .
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'm looking for Bob . __eou__ He's in a meeting with Phil . __eou__ No problem , I can wait .

John , do you have a minute ? __eou__ Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . __eou__ But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . __eou__ Has anybody spoken to him about it ? __eou__ No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . __eou__ We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? __eou__ No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . __eou__ How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__ Oh , that would be too small . __eou__ With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__ Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__ Let's rock n ' roll .
Hello , Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today . __eou__ Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . __eou__ I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . __eou__ Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? __eou__ I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . __eou__ How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__ That will be fine .
Kim , have you made contact with Mr . Lee ? __eou__ Not yet , Mr . Wang .

Oh , this is Monica __eou__ OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . __eou__ Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . __eou__ Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . __eou__ Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? __eou__ Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . __eou__ And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? __eou__ Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . __eou__ I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? __eou__ They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . __eou__ What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? __eou__ A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct .
I've been working hard for a whole year . I really need a break . __eou__ That's true . You need to take some time off to relax . __eou__ You said it .

Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . __eou__ We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__ That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__ Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? __eou__ I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . __eou__ Well , we'll consider your proposal .
This is our best product . __eou__ How long will it take to make five hundred ? __eou__ They'll be done before the end of the week . __eou__ Good .
Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? __eou__ I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . __eou__ I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . __eou__ To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . __eou__ Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum .
I am here to get my prescription filled . __eou__ Your prescription will be ready in twenty minutes . __eou__ Do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail ? __eou__ Yes , in fact , you can renew this prescription over the Internet and have it delivered to your home . __eou__ How should I take this medication ? __eou__ You should take it twice a day . __eou__ Should I avoid alcohol with this medication ? __eou__ You need something in your stomach when you take it .

I need to get my prescription filled . __eou__ You may pick it up in twenty minutes . __eou__ If I wanted to , could I have it mailed to me ? __eou__ Yes , and you can renew this prescription by phone . __eou__ Are there any special instructions about this medication ? __eou__ Take it three times a day . __eou__ Can I take it with food ? __eou__ You should take this medicine with food and no alcohol . __eou__ Are there any side effects with this medication ? __eou__ You might get a little dizzy , but that is it .
How have you been doing ? __eou__ I can ’ t sleep or eat . I have a really bad pain in my tooth ! __eou__ How long have you had this toothache ? __eou__ It bothers me off and on , but it ’ s gotten much worse these past few weeks . __eou__ Is there anything that you ’ Ve done to your tooth that might have caused the pain ? __eou__ My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep . Maybe that is the problem . __eou__ When you brush your teeth , what do you use ? __eou__ I use a soft bristle toothbrush . __eou__ Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot ? __eou__ Absolutely . That set it off big time !
I need help picking out a lotion . __eou__ It would be my pleasure to help you . What do you need help with ? __eou__ I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching . __eou__ We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream . __eou__ Do you find that one works better than the other ? __eou__ I have heard that the cream is longer lasting . __eou__ Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ? __eou__ If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot . __eou__ Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak . __eou__ It was a pleasure . Come back anytime .

I was told to come to you to get a chest X-ray . __eou__ No problem . Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__ Then what should I do ? __eou__ You will stand over here up against this plate . __eou__ Should I just stand naturally ? __eou__ You will raise your arms up shoulder high . __eou__ Is this all right ? __eou__ Yes , you are doing great . __eou__ Where will you be going ? __eou__ I need to stand behind this shield . Now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out . __eou__ Is that it ? __eou__ That ’ s it . You can get dressed when the film is developed .

Are you feeling OK ? __eou__ My stomach is bothering me . __eou__ What have you been eating ? __eou__ I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . __eou__ Maybe the food had something wrong with it . __eou__ It could be bad food , but I didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either . __eou__ Have you been under a lot of pressure lately ? __eou__ I haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual . __eou__ Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around . __eou__ I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu .
My doctor said that I need a chest X-ray . __eou__ Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__ What should I do after that ? __eou__ You need to come over here and face this plate . __eou__ Am I standing the right way ? __eou__ I will need your arms raised to shoulder height . __eou__ Am I doing this the right way ? __eou__ Everything you are doing is perfect . __eou__ Are you going to leave ? __eou__ I am just getting behind this screen .

Things have been going OK . __eou__ Maybe you have a touch of the flu . __eou__ I think that I might be getting the flu .
You don ’ t look so good . __eou__ I feel horrible . I think I picked up a bug . __eou__ Do you know who you got it from ? __eou__ A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there . __eou__ Did you take any cold medication ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . __eou__ I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . __eou__ My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . __eou__ A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . __eou__ Yes , if I get worse , I will definitely look for extra help with this .
You look a bit under the weather . __eou__ I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . __eou__ I know that it ’ s going around the dorms . __eou__ My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me . __eou__ I have some cold tablets if you would like one . __eou__ Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup . __eou__ Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold . __eou__ My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . __eou__ You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . __eou__ If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions .

I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . __eou__ Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? __eou__ I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . __eou__ Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? __eou__ I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea .
Excuse me , professor . I need to go home now . __eou__ Is everything OK ? __eou__ I just feel funny . __eou__ What exactly seems to be the matter ? __eou__ I have a terrible headache . __eou__ Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center ? __eou__ I already have some medicine at home if I could just get there . __eou__ Do you need someone to drive you home ? __eou__ Thank you , but the bus stops right at my house . __eou__ Well , go home and rest up .

Hi , the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today . __eou__ I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run . __eou__ I think that this is a bad sign . __eou__ For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned . __eou__ Why wouldn ’ t you tell me over the phone ? __eou__ If there is any question about test results , we always do a recheck . __eou__ I need to come in right away . __eou__ I would be happy to see you this afternoon .

No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . __eou__ Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? __eou__ Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . __eou__ Alright Steve . Your social security number ? __eou__ 349-95- 8821 . __eou__ Do you have medical insurance ? __eou__ Yes , I do .

Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . __eou__ It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . __eou__ Yes , I need to refill it today . __eou__ Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__ I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__ Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__ Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__ But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__ Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__ But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__ A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__ Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__ Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__ This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__ Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
Good morning , how are you doing today ? __eou__ I have been feeling pretty good , Dr . Smith . __eou__ So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . __eou__ Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . __eou__ We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . __eou__ I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . Can you look at that ? __eou__ Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . __eou__ Thank you . What will the blood test tell you ? __eou__ We will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count . __eou__ I have been working hard to stay healthy . I hope the tests turn out well .
I need help . I think my arm is broken . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? __eou__ No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . __eou__ I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . __eou__ Let me see a doctor . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 . __eou__ I thought this was the emergency room . __eou__ It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? __eou__ No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? __eou__ My left arm . __eou__ Can you fill out this form then ? __eou__ No , I can't . I'm left-handed . __eou__ That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . __eou__ Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . __eou__ Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? __eou__ I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . __eou__ Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . __eou__ I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__ Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__ O . K . __eou__ Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . __eou__ I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . __eou__ Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . __eou__ O . K . , thanks , doctor .
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . __eou__ What part hurts ? __eou__ The shoulder . __eou__ Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . __eou__ It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . __eou__ C'mon . Just don't move . __eou__ I'm bleeding too much . __eou__ We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? __eou__ Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! __eou__ There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__ Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__ Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__ No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__ Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?
My wife is in labor ! __eou__ Here , Ma ’ am please get on the stretcher . __eou__ Is Doctor Hawkins here ? She ’ s our doctor . We called her from the car . __eou__ Calm down , sir . We ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way . __eou__ Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks . __eou__ How long has she been in labor ? __eou__ About fifteen minutes . __eou__ O . K . Are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready .
Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there . __eou__ We better see if he ’ s o . k . __eou__ Sir ... sir ? Are you all right ? Sir ? __eou__ He ’ s not answering . You ’ d better check his pulse and breathing . __eou__ Oh , no . He ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 . __eou__ Hello ? Yes . Someone has passed out at Connecticut Ave . and 1st St . He isn ’ t breathing and does not have a pulse . Yes . My friend is performing CPR . OK . Thank you . They ’ re sending an ambulance . Here , let me help .
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me ! __eou__ Where does it hurt the most ? __eou__ Right here !

You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! __eou__ Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies ! __eou__ Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! __eou__ Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . __eou__ Thanks doc , bye !

But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? __eou__ No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? __eou__ My left arm . __eou__ Can you fill out this form then ? __eou__ No , I can't . I'm left-handed . __eou__ That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . __eou__ Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . __eou__ Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? __eou__ No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . __eou__ Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? __eou__ Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . __eou__ Alright Steve . Your social security number ? __eou__ 349-95- 8821 . __eou__ Do you have medical insurance ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Blue Cross . __eou__ Do you have your insurance card with you ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ Well , you can call it in later .

Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . __eou__ Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . __eou__ Is it gonna hurt ? __eou__ No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . __eou__ Ok , spit .
Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? __eou__ Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . __eou__ Have you ever had any trauma ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ Does the pian become more intense at night ? __eou__ Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . __eou__ Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . __eou__ By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? __eou__ Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We'll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ? __eou__ Yes . Let's start today .
Doctor , I feel much better now . Will I be albe to go home some time this week ? __eou__ That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . __eou__ Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? __eou__ Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks . __eou__ Is there anything I should do ? __eou__ You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while . __eou__ Should I take some medicine ? __eou__ Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks , please . __eou__ It's very kind of you . __eou__ You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye .
Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . __eou__ Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . __eou__ What if it's broken ? __eou__ Then we'll put you in a cast . __eou__ What do you mean by a cast ? __eou__ Well , we apply tape and plaster to from a solid enclosure to protect the bones from moving . In this way they will heal properly . Take it easy . It won't hurt you . Let me see . The X-ray picture indicates that your humerus is broken in two places . And you'll have to wear the cast for three weeks . You'll need to come back in two weeks , so I can have another look .
Could you make up this prescription for me , please ? __eou__ Certainly . I'll do it for you right away . Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock . __eou__ What can I do ? __eou__ Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ? __eou__ Could I ? __eou__ Certainly . I recommend this medicine . It's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . And it helps just as much . In fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , I promise . __eou__ Great . I'll take this brand . And how do I take these medicines ? __eou__ This is for internal use . Two tablets , four times a day . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome .
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Hello , may I make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ? __eou__ I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled . __eou__ Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . __eou__ Let me see ... Perhaps I could fit you in at five thirty . __eou__ Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six . __eou__ What about tomorrow morning , then ? __eou__ No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled . __eou__ I guess it can't be helped . __eou__ You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine . __eou__ All right , then . See you this afternoon . __eou__ How kind of you ! Good-bye .
Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . __eou__ Please wait till your name is called . OK . Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? __eou__ No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . __eou__ In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork .
Good morning . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve god a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ? __eou__ I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? __eou__ Yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . __eou__ Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . __eou__ OK . I can afford to take a few days off work . __eou__ Have you been working hard recently ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . __eou__ Good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ I have a bad headache , but ... __eou__ Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . __eou__ Thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye .

Taylor . __eou__ Oh !
Hello , Doctor . __eou__ Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? __eou__ It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . __eou__ How long has this been going on ? __eou__ About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . __eou__ How was your appetite ? __eou__ Pretty good , I'd say . __eou__ You haven't lost any weight , have you ? __eou__ No , doctor .

We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ? __eou__ It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . __eou__ What is your greatest weakness ? __eou__ Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule . __eou__ What is the greatest disappointment in your life ? __eou__ Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me . __eou__ Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work , if you are hired ? __eou__ I will start my work at the beginning of next month .
Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment . __eou__ Is that difficult ? __eou__ Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you . __eou__ That's all right . What can I do ? __eou__ Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . __eou__ Well . I can do it . And then ? __eou__ The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ? __eou__ Who will pay for these things ? __eou__ Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . __eou__ OK . I will go in no time .
Now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . Please sit down . __eou__ I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ? __eou__ B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ? __eou__ It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? __eou__ Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . __eou__ I will leave a memo for you , sir .
Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ? __eou__ What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints . __eou__ Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are . __eou__ I see . And the quantities . __eou__ 200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample . __eou__ How many rolls altogether ? __eou__ Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . __eou__ Six weeks , did you say ? __eou__ Yes , five to six weeks . __eou__ We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks . __eou__ Eight weeks ? We can wait that long . __eou__ That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid . __eou__ Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? __eou__ What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . __eou__ That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose . __eou__ Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ When can we expect your confirmation of the order ? __eou__ As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday . __eou__ All right .
What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? __eou__ Cartons . Is that okay ? __eou__ I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . __eou__ Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__ In that case , I guess I can rest assured . __eou__ Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__ You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__ We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__ It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . __eou__ Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it .
Could I have a word with you , Madam ? __eou__ Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . __eou__ I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . __eou__ So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? __eou__ I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . __eou__ Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . __eou__ Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . __eou__ That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? __eou__ I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not . __eou__ Well , take care of yourself . And hope you will be better as soon as possible .
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . __eou__ I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . __eou__ I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? __eou__ I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . __eou__ But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . __eou__ I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together .
Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form . __eou__ Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? __eou__ Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . __eou__ Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? __eou__ Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . __eou__ Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents .
Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . __eou__ Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . __eou__ Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . __eou__ But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . __eou__ Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . __eou__ Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? __eou__ This afternoon .
Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . __eou__ Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__ And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . __eou__ What can I do next ? __eou__ The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . __eou__ Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? __eou__ Maybe we should call its after-service man .
How much tea are you going to order ? __eou__ We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . __eou__ When do you want to deliver the goods ? __eou__ We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . __eou__ I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . __eou__ I can agree to that . __eou__ Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__ Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship .
How many do you intend to order for our shirts ? __eou__ What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? __eou__ We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . __eou__ No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? __eou__ Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . __eou__ And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . __eou__ Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . __eou__ That's great .
We like your product , and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible . __eou__ Well , we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays . Our factories will be closed for another week . __eou__ That's all right . We will send you a purchase order in one week . I hope you will be able to take care of it . __eou__ No problem . Once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . __eou__ Thanks . We need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . By the way , will payment against delivery be OK ? __eou__ That will be fine . And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order .
Steven , have a rest . Could you have a talk with me ? __eou__ OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? __eou__ When do you want me to come ? __eou__ Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you . __eou__ That's fine . I can make it .
Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? __eou__ Sure , what's the matter ? __eou__ As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . __eou__ What do you think we can do about this ? __eou__ We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . __eou__ Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . __eou__ I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . __eou__ OK ! I will try this .
Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here . __eou__ Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? __eou__ Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . __eou__ If you have any further questions , just ask me . __eou__ OK . Thank you very much . __eou__ You are welcome . Have a nice day .
I have read your resume.What is your last job ? __eou__ I've worked in the Production Department for two years . __eou__ Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ? __eou__ Working with my colleagues , we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 % . __eou__ Great ! Could you tell me your educational background ? __eou__ Yes . I got a bachelor's degree in English from Beijing University . __eou__ Why are you willing to work for our company ? __eou__ I can get more promotion in your company . __eou__ OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days . __eou__ Thank you .
My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . __eou__ I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . __eou__ Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__ I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__ That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__ I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review .
In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? __eou__ Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? __eou__ How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? __eou__ I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . __eou__ Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . __eou__ Thanks for your praise , Madam .
We should know by next month whom to hire .

I hope to hear from you as soon as possible . __eou__ Please send the next candidate in on your way out . __eou__ OK , good-bye .
Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ? __eou__ This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? __eou__ Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? __eou__ We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . __eou__ Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? __eou__ Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? __eou__ Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea .
Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company . __eou__ Hi , Jimmy , good morning . __eou__ I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person . __eou__ I see . __eou__ We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . __eou__ Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . __eou__ We surely believe you . __eou__ Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? __eou__ I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . __eou__ Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know . __eou__ OK .
Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ? __eou__ Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company . __eou__ Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . __eou__ But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . __eou__ My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . __eou__ What's the meeting for ? __eou__ It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . __eou__ I will be there after 20 minutes .

So awful ! I never fancy my salary is so little . __eou__ Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise . __eou__ Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . __eou__ So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . __eou__ I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . __eou__ You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . __eou__ That sounds reasonable . __eou__ Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . __eou__ That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . __eou__ Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it .

As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months .

And you can ask me any question . __eou__ Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . __eou__ But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview . __eou__ I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company . __eou__ Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now .

Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . __eou__ Which terms ? __eou__ First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . __eou__ Good . I will add this to the contract . __eou__ The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . __eou__ Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? __eou__ As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . __eou__ Well , we have agreed on all the major points .
We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? __eou__ As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . __eou__ Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? __eou__ Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . __eou__ I see . Why not use wooden cases ? __eou__ If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__ Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__ Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . __eou__ Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__ That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__ Sounds good .
I'm afraid I've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I will explain the problem briefly . We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged . __eou__ Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port . __eou__ Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau . According to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases . __eou__ Our goods are well-examined before shipment . I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route . __eou__ Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately . __eou__ We will check with the parties concerned right away .
Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ? __eou__ I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting . __eou__ Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? __eou__ I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues .
What course did you like best ? __eou__ Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . __eou__ Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? __eou__ Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school .
What ’ s your major weak point ? __eou__ I haven ’ t been involved in international business , so I don ’ t have any experience . __eou__ What are you greatest strength ? __eou__ Honest , hardworking and responsible . __eou__ Does your present employer know you are looking for another job ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but I am sure he will understand .
How do you spend your spare time ? Are you interested in sports ? __eou__ I have many hobbies , I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to pop songs . __eou__ Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I think I am extroverted .
Have you finished that report yet ? __eou__ No . I'm still working on it . __eou__ How much time do you need ? __eou__ Give me one more day .
Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . __eou__ Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . __eou__ It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . __eou__ If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . __eou__ Well , can you explain it to me ? __eou__ The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . __eou__ Can you reduce more ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . __eou__ In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . __eou__ It is so hard to deal with . __eou__ If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price is the best we can make .
How about the repair fee ? __eou__ It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years . __eou__ Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ? __eou__ They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment . __eou__ I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? __eou__ That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation . __eou__ To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time . __eou__ Thank you again !
Mrs . Lin . Please hold all of my calls for the next hour . __eou__ OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? __eou__ Yes , I'll talk to her . __eou__ All right .

What are you doing , Janice ? __eou__ I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work __eou__ Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? __eou__ Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . __eou__ You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? __eou__ I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . __eou__ So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . __eou__ The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . __eou__ Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? __eou__ Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent .

Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? __eou__ Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__ I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . __eou__ Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__ I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible .
May I speak to Marry ? __eou__ She's in a meeting until noon . __eou__ Ok , I'll try her back then . __eou__ Ok , thank you .
OK ! Let's get down to business now . __eou__ Say it . __eou__ As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . __eou__ That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__ I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . __eou__ Could you put it in detail ? __eou__ Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . __eou__ I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . __eou__ What kind of media do you recommend ? __eou__ I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . __eou__ Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__ I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image .
You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years . How do you like the job ? __eou__ I like it very much . __eou__ If I may ask , are you happy with your salary ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t mind at all . I receive 3,000 RIB a month , after tax . __eou__ Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid there isn ’ t . My boss only pays lip service . __eou__ What is your salary expectation for this position ? __eou__ My expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 RIB range . That ’ s the take-home pay .
Let's get down to business . __eou__ OK . Have you seen the samples ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I'm interested in your underwear . If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . We are trying to give you a favourable one . __eou__ What's your price ? __eou__ 150 yuan for each piece . __eou__ That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay . __eou__ How about 130 yuan ? __eou__ I offer you 110 yuan . __eou__ That's too little . Well , I'll come down to 120 yuan . __eou__ All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? __eou__ If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . __eou__ Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . __eou__ Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe .
What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . __eou__ What makes you angry ? __eou__ Dishonesty . It ’ s unacceptable .
Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . __eou__ Sure . What's your date of delivery ? __eou__ I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__ What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__ I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__ I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__ Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract .
Hi , Tom ! This is Marry with Hans furniture store . __eou__ Yes , Marry ? __eou__ I just wanted to let you to know that we had decided to offer the sales position to someone else . __eou__ I see . __eou__ We considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience . __eou__ Maybe so . But I'm fast learner and I'm willing to work overtime to learn the business . __eou__ I'm sure you are . __eou__ I must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance .

It's safer that way . __eou__ Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . __eou__ It's in the eyes .

Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . __eou__ Why did you pick this organization ? __eou__ I'm very much interested in the position . __eou__ What made you decide to join our company ? __eou__ I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours .
It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? __eou__ We need to work is because we need money to live .

Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ?
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution .
Do you have some questions ? __eou__ Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . __eou__ If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory .

You have worked in your present company for five years . __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Why do you want to resign ? __eou__ As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity . __eou__ What kind of work are you interested in ? __eou__ Just as you advertised in the newspaper . __eou__ So you are interested in our company . __eou__ Yes , what's more , your company is one of the largest and best trading companies in this line of business .

It's not part of my job . __eou__ What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__ I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging .
I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so .

I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? __eou__ It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate .
I've just taken a spanner set from the stores . __eou__ That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory . __eou__ Sorry , what do you mean ? __eou__ When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder .
Has my package arrived ? __eou__ I'm not sure . What does it look like ? __eou__ It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long .

Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . __eou__ This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below .
Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? __eou__ Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . __eou__ So , is it actually paper at this stage ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths .
How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? __eou__ We try to recycle as much as we can . __eou__ What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? __eou__ We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__ But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__ Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill
Good morning . May I help you ? __eou__ Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . __eou__ He's not in , I'm afraid . __eou__ But Could you tell me when he will be back ? __eou__ I am sorry , I don't know . __eou__ well , do you think I could leave a message for him ? __eou__ Certainly .

Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . __eou__ OK , I'll do it right now . __eou__ By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . __eou__ Yes , I get it . __eou__ OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do .
Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? __eou__ Of course , Mr . Green . __eou__ Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon . __eou__ No problem .

You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? __eou__ We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . __eou__ What about the packaging ? __eou__ We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want .
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? __eou__ They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too .
Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . __eou__ Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . __eou__ Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? __eou__ Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers .
Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's definitely a growing business . __eou__ What do you recycle in your plant ? __eou__ Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . __eou__ How is plastic recycled , then ? __eou__ Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . __eou__ Is that the method you use here ? __eou__ No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . __eou__ How do you do that ? __eou__ By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets .

How often do you service the pump ? __eou__ We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . __eou__ How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? __eou__ Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble !
What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? __eou__ It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time .

This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year .

I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . __eou__ But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . You can get much information about environment of investment .
Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? __eou__ Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__ Well , what about price ? __eou__ The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance .
What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__ What is your weakness ? __eou__ I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . __eou__ What is your greatest accomplishment ? __eou__ I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . __eou__ Can you work under pressure ? __eou__ Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . __eou__ What are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them ? __eou__ There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . __eou__ How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__ I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later .
Do you have any special skills ? __eou__ I can write computer programs , I have a good command of secretarial skills . __eou__ What qualifications have you got ? __eou__ I have a doctor license and a driving license . __eou__ Do you get special training in office skills ? __eou__ I passed both the Cambridge Examinations ( First Certificate and the Certificate of Proficiency in English ); and studied for a year in London at the Lucas Secretarial College , ending with speeds of 120 words per minute in English shorthand and 50 words per minute in typing .

I hate this part of my job . __eou__ Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire .
How would you like this order shipped ? __eou__ Send it by the fastest way . __eou__ Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . __eou__ How much ? __eou__ I'll check the costs and call you back . __eou__ OK .
We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break . __eou__ Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee .
Your definition on success ? __eou__ Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__ What ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__ Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__ How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? __eou__ Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . __eou__ How would your present boss describe you ? __eou__ He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . __eou__ What would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__ They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague .
What's your ideal boss ? __eou__ I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .
And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? __eou__ Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . __eou__ Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? __eou__ No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . __eou__ What's your strong points ? __eou__ Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . __eou__ What do you dislike most about your job ? __eou__ Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . __eou__ What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? __eou__ A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . __eou__ Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? __eou__ Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . __eou__ How do you feel about overtime work ? __eou__ That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . __eou__ What is most important to you in a job ? __eou__ I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . __eou__ Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . __eou__ Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? __eou__ Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . __eou__ OK . What are your strong points ? __eou__ Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . __eou__ And your weaknesses ? __eou__ I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job .

How do you get along with your boss ? __eou__ I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . __eou__ What do you think is important in your work ? __eou__ Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results .
I've heard that you are going to call for a tender . What kind of goods would you like to buy ? __eou__ Yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . You're well informed . We'd like to build new factory . __eou__ When do you open the tender ? And where ? __eou__ We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing . __eou__ And when is the closing date ? __eou__ The time period is set on June 29th . __eou__ Could you please tell me something more about the conditions for the tender ? __eou__ All right . The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters . You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow . __eou__ Thank you for your information . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__ I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time . __eou__ It doesn't matter . We'll be in touch . __eou__ Okay , bye ! __eou__ Bye !
Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ? __eou__ I should be most delighted . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . White . __eou__ Delighted I was able to help .

What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? __eou__ I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . __eou__ What computer languages have you learned ? __eou__ Visual C + + , C and Delphi . __eou__ Have you gotten any special training in programming ? __eou__ No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge .
When you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? __eou__ I enjoyed everything , as long as I was learning . __eou__ Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . __eou__ Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . __eou__ That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . __eou__ If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again .
Steven , what's your idea of price ? __eou__ The best we can do is $ 120 per case . __eou__ I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . __eou__ I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . __eou__ Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . __eou__ It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? __eou__ Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . __eou__ Take your time , please .
How is your English ability ? __eou__ Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . __eou__ Could you tell me something about your English education ? __eou__ I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors . __eou__ Have you passed College English Test Band 4 or Band 6 ? __eou__ Band 6 . __eou__ Great . Can you file in English ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t , but I'd be glad to learn . __eou__ You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ? __eou__ Yes , I think I can . I often talk to foreigners at English corner held twice a week at my college . They say my English is pretty good . __eou__ Excellent . How is your English ability in reading and writing ? __eou__ I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English . __eou__ Oh , I see .
Can you read and write English and French ? __eou__ No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . __eou__ Could you tell me something about your English education ? __eou__ My mother is an English teacher in a college , so I began learning English when I could speak , and I took English as my minor subject at university .
China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__ It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . __eou__ We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__ Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies .
Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__ The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__ In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__ Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__ How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? __eou__ Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . __eou__ As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? __eou__ The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . __eou__ Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__ Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement .
What do you think of our price ? __eou__ Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__ Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__ I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . __eou__ I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__ I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__ I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__ Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__ We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes this is the best we can do . __eou__ I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered .
What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ? __eou__ I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account . __eou__ That certainly is quite an accomplishment . __eou__ Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account . __eou__ What's your sales record been like there ? __eou__ The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year , so I ’ m very pleased . And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years . __eou__ If things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ? __eou__ Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on .
Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . __eou__ I'm on my way .
Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . __eou__ All right . In my first teaching position I received the ' Excellent Teaching ' award the past two years in succession . __eou__ Have you received any other honors ? __eou__ Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Prominent Youths of Beijing ' __eou__ Do you have anything published ? __eou__ Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Young Writer's Collection .
Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? __eou__ It is because of the quality . __eou__ Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__ I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . __eou__ Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . __eou__ I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it .
Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ What is the tariff ? __eou__ It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . __eou__ Why does the government levy the tariff ? __eou__ Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . __eou__ Anything else . __eou__ Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__ Do not mention it .
Could you copy this document for me ? __eou__ It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ? __eou__ A hundred and fifty . No , wait , make that a hundred and sixty . __eou__ Yes , sir . Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No , thank you . That will be all for now . __eou__ Your document will be ready in about ten minutes .
Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ? __eou__ Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . __eou__ Can you give an example ? __eou__ For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives . __eou__ Oh , Are there other means ? __eou__ Technical barriers are set for imported goods . __eou__ This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food .
Miss Liu , please come in . __eou__ What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ Copy this report for me . __eou__ OK . But which size should I use ? __eou__ You should use the A4 paper is all right . __eou__ I see . Should I have it bound ? __eou__ It is unnecessary . __eou__ That is all right .
Why isn't the project done yet ? __eou__ How should I know ? It's not my responsibility .
Where do you see yourself three years from now ? __eou__ Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm ! __eou__ Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? __eou__ Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company . __eou__ Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? __eou__ Well , a working relationship . I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important . But I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss .
Are you introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . __eou__ What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life .
What do you consider to be your strong points ? __eou__ I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . __eou__ Really ? Are you still playing ? __eou__ Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . __eou__ I see . You must be tough . __eou__ I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . __eou__ What do you consider to be your weak points ? __eou__ Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . __eou__ What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? __eou__ So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . __eou__ Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? __eou__ It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team .
Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . __eou__ Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__ I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go .
Miss Liu , have we received the fax from MS Company yet ? __eou__ Let me check - - oh , here it is . It just arrived a few minutes ago . __eou__ Excellent . I have been expecting it . __eou__ Is it important ? __eou__ You bet it is . It's about the new contract . __eou__ Here it is , sir .
What did you usually do as a head nurse ? __eou__ I allocate different patients with their consent to different nurses . And I supervise the primary nurses and help nurses carry out their work . __eou__ How to maintain a high standard of nursing ? __eou__ To maintain a high standard of nursing , we should take experience and education into consideration while considering a nurse's level of expertise in caring for various patients .
Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? __eou__ My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . __eou__ What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? __eou__ First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data .
Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? __eou__ Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . __eou__ I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__ I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__ What's your proposal then ? __eou__ I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__ We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__ As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__ 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__ That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__ What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__ To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__ 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__ If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__ How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__ 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__ Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__ Ok . Let's call it a deal .
We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . __eou__ Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__ This is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__ If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__ Then , what's your countr-offer ? __eou__ This is our counter-offer . __eou__ We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__ So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__ How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__ Agreed .
I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles .

They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand . __eou__ Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line .

Did you hear something ? __eou__ Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__ It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__ You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__ Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__ Good idea .

Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . __eou__ What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . __eou__ Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent .

Did you see the woman that just left my office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ But it's the style now . __eou__ I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ What happened to her ? __eou__ Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__ I see .

The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . __eou__ That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__ Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? __eou__ It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . __eou__ I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . __eou__ Good idea .
I called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__ For the bank manager ? __eou__ That ’ s the one . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . __eou__ Well , no surprise there . __eou__ No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__ Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__ I ’ m going there tomorrow . __eou__ Great ! Good luck . __eou__ And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__ Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are .

You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__ And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__ That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__ Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__ Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__ I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__ Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__ I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__ As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do .

Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? __eou__ No , nothing in particular . Thank you . __eou__ Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . __eou__ Yes , but I don't mind working hard .
I have a feeling you will get this job . __eou__ Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . __eou__ Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . __eou__ Have you updated your resume recently ? __eou__ Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . __eou__ You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . __eou__ I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . __eou__ Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ? __eou__ Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . __eou__ I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . __eou__ Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing !
What is your long term career plan you set for yourself ? __eou__ First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network .

Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do .

We can offer you a 5 % discount . __eou__ Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . __eou__ Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? __eou__ When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . __eou__ What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . __eou__ There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . __eou__ How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . __eou__ Ok . I can settle for that .
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . __eou__ That's right . Let's go into details of it . __eou__ Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__ Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? __eou__ No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ I hope you can try to get them to step up production . __eou__ They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . __eou__ If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? __eou__ By the middle of October . This is the best we can do . __eou__ All right . I'll take your words at that . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . And we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early September . __eou__ I promise .

I'm looking forward to that .
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__ I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__ I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ Ok .

Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . __eou__ OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you .

Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__ I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__ I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders .

Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . __eou__ The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . __eou__ Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__ I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__ Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you .

I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . __eou__ Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . __eou__ I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . __eou__ Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . __eou__ Yeah , I guess I am .

Either I shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__ Well , I think you may be overreacting .

Make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__ Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . __eou__ No , it's unnecessary .

You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? __eou__ Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . __eou__ Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . __eou__ I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... __eou__ One of the best in the company . __eou__ That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__ Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? __eou__ That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery .

I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? __eou__ Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__ I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__ Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__ As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__ Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__ I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__ Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__ Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__ Interesting idea . You might be on to something .

Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ? __eou__ Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did . __eou__ What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No ! __eou__ That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . __eou__ But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ? __eou__ I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them .
My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . __eou__ Wow . You are a real snake . __eou__ It's business , Dave . __eou__ I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? __eou__ Right . The faint of heart should not apply . __eou__ I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__ So do I .
I'm really confused , Zina . Will you explain all this to me ? __eou__ Look , we need to have the Stars.com account , right ? __eou__ Yes . If we get it , we'll really be set for success . __eou__ And to get it , we have to beat WebTracker to the punch . __eou__ OK , I'm with you so far . __eou__ That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week .
Excuse me sir.May I come in ? __eou__ Mike , you're late again . __eou__ I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I __eou__ Do you think I believe the story like that ? __eou__ But it's true . __eou__ How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__ That's coincidence 。 __eou__ Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 __eou__ I promise I will . __eou__ You'd better .

I work very hard . __eou__ Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently.And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__ Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__ It's unfair . __eou__ We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__ OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__ All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day .

And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . __eou__ Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried .

Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so .

People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .

It is a special occasion . I've got to be there , right ? __eou__ Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ Thank you so much .
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__ That is very encouraging news .

What is your solution , then ? __eou__ The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .

Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . __eou__ We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . __eou__ Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? __eou__ Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . __eou__ And this is your company's head office ? __eou__ Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . __eou__ That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? __eou__ That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . __eou__ That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? __eou__ Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation .
These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? __eou__ I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! __eou__ What is our time frame ? __eou__ Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch .
I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . __eou__ Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__ Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__ What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? __eou__ Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__ Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ...
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . __eou__ So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__ Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , please .
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? __eou__ Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . __eou__ Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . __eou__ Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__ What ! I resent that ! __eou__ Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol !
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__ Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__ No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__ And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__ Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job .
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__ Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__ Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__ Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__ But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__ Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff !
Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . __eou__ Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . __eou__ You wanna take some time off , is that right ? __eou__ Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . __eou__ What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__ I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__ Well , I guess so .
I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__ Have you decided ? __eou__ Yes , I want to get a better job . __eou__ Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__ I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__ Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out . __eou__ I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__ OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? __eou__ Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__ Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes , but why should you want to do that ? __eou__ Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . I'd delighted if you did .
John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . __eou__ Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . __eou__ No . Come here right now . __eou__ OK . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . __eou__ Why ? I work very hard . __eou__ Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__ Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__ It's unfair . __eou__ We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__ OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__ All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day .
How do you like your job here , Linda ? __eou__ It's interesting , I like being an editor . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . __eou__ I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__ I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__ Do you have any complaints ? __eou__ No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? __eou__ Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . __eou__ That's perfect . I will definitely do well .
If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . __eou__ Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . __eou__ Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . __eou__ Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously .
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase the survival of the fittest .

Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . __eou__ Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? __eou__ Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . __eou__ It certainly is .

Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . __eou__ Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__ Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . __eou__ What would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__ Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__ So , what changed ? __eou__ Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ Wow , a real step up ! __eou__ Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK .

I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school . __eou__ Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__ Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student newspaper , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__ What did that involve ? __eou__ Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__ I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , okay .
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__ For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world , and this seemed like a good first step . __eou__ Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills . __eou__ Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__ The London Weekly right ? __eou__ Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .

What did you do at the office today ? __eou__ I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__ What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__ The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so they get special prices . __eou__ I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__ I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and requirements . __eou__ It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client . __eou__ I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__ Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__ You certainly had a busy day . __eou__ That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning .

I'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__ That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? __eou__ Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? __eou__ All right I'll read it soon . __eou__ Excuse me for taking your time . __eou__ Oh . It's nothing Navy .

All them one afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , it is not easy . __eou__ It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? __eou__ Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . __eou__ What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . __eou__ Didn't you get the memo ? __eou__ What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . __eou__ The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . __eou__ You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? __eou__ It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? __eou__ I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . __eou__ That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos .
Here is the document you asked for this morning . __eou__ Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__ This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__ The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging . __eou__ Can I leave a message for him please ? __eou__ Of course , can you leave your name and number ? I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . __eou__ My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? I have a rather timely matter to discuss with him . __eou__ Can you tell me what it's about ? I can make a note of it , so Mr . Nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call . __eou__ Yes , please let him know I would like to discuss the Girard case with him .
Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__ I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__ Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__ He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call .
Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? __eou__ Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda __eou__ Ok . __eou__ I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? __eou__ It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM . __eou__ Yes , there is . See you then .
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__ To visit our supplier ? __eou__ Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__ Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__ No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__ Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__ I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__ I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip .
Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ? __eou__ Er ? I am driving right now . Can you call back in 30 minutes ? __eou__ Sure . Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you .

But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . __eou__ Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . __eou__ Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Bye .
... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? __eou__ Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource .
Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview .

Could you then print these for me ? __eou__ Sure , just send me through internal mail . __eou__ Thanks , Vivian . __eou__ No problem at all . Welcome .
Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . __eou__ Where are you ? __eou__ I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . __eou__ Ok .
I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__ Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? __eou__ Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ Thank you so much .
Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__ I know , but I am really sick . __eou__ Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__ I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__ I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__ This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__ Thank you , I will be doing my best .
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__ Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__ I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__ Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__ How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__ I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? __eou__ We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . __eou__ Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . __eou__ I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . __eou__ I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . __eou__ I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__ We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? __eou__ I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? __eou__ Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . __eou__ Thank you very much .
I ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__ It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . Brown . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? __eou__ I ’ m interested in your hardware . I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada . Here is a list of my requirements , for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , C . I . F . Vancouver . __eou__ Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers ? __eou__ I ’ ll do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? __eou__ Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__ What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . __eou__ As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . __eou__ You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . __eou__ That ’ s something we can discuss later .
How do I submit an expense report ? __eou__ You need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__ You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__ Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you .
Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . __eou__ Here you are . Do you need glue ? __eou__ That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__ I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__ We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__ I propose we accept the minutes . __eou__ Good . Do I have a second ? __eou__ I second . __eou__ motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__ I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__ What kind of action is required ? __eou__ If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval .
Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__ Go ahead , please . __eou__ How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__ You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__ What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__ We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__ How often is the bonus ? __eou__ You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__ Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__ We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__ Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__ Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__ You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__ Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__ Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__ It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__ Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__ Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__ My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad .
What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? __eou__ Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__ What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__ It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__ Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__ We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__ Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__ It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about .
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__ Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__ We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__ What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__ Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like .
Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . __eou__ Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__ Should each of us write separately ? __eou__ Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see .
May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__ Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__ Thank you for telling me that . __eou__ But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__ What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . __eou__ Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__ I got it . __eou__ Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__ I see
I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . __eou__ Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? __eou__ No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . __eou__ Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__ Would you please ask when he will be free ? __eou__ Have a seat please while I call .
Is Mr . Thomas there , please ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t hear you . Could you please speak up a little ? __eou__ I said , is Mr . Thomas there ? __eou__ Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ’ t hang up please . I ’ ll have the call transferred to another line .
Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . __eou__ Would you like some coffee or tea ? __eou__ Coffee would be fine . __eou__ How would you like your coffee ? __eou__ I like it black . __eou__ Coffee will be right with you .
May I speak to Mr . Thomas ? __eou__ Unfortunately , he has left for the day . __eou__ I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him __eou__ I ’ ll make sure he gets the message .
We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__ Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? __eou__ We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__ Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .

Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . __eou__ I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . __eou__ Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? __eou__ I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . __eou__ How do you work with a team ? __eou__ I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . __eou__ What ’ s your long term goal ? __eou__ I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans .
Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? __eou__ Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ...
It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . __eou__ We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . __eou__ Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__ Goodbye .
What are in this folder ? __eou__ They are reports of our company . __eou__ Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__ No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__ Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__ No problem , here you are .
Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . __eou__ This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__ I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__ Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__ That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__ At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping .
Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? __eou__ Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__ Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__ Yes , it will print immediately .
I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__ It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__ Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__ Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__ Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__ Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? __eou__ Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__ I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__ Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot .
Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__ Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__ And what is the most important point ? __eou__ You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
Hello , this is Francis . __eou__ Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__ Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__ Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__ That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__ We must find some time to read report . __eou__ I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__ See you .
We have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__ What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__ The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__ Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , it is not easy . __eou__ It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things .
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__ Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__ Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__ I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ You mean the network connection ? __eou__ Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__ I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ Ok .
What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__ No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__ You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__ The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week .
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__ In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__ First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__ Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find .

I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__ You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__ So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__ Unless they're united , very little ...

Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__ I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__ What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__ Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__ Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__ There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__ I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__ I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__ When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__ My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__ How would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__ First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law .

Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__ Let ’ s rock n ’ roll .
We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . __eou__ I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . __eou__ You have some doubts about our products , I understand . __eou__ I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . __eou__ Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__ And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__ That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__ So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__ Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . __eou__ I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? __eou__ Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . __eou__ I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . __eou__ I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__ Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . __eou__ Yes .

I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous .

Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position .
Please switch work shifts with me . __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Why can't you ? __eou__ Because I have other obligations .

Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ? __eou__ I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . __eou__ Then use the xerox machine . __eou__ It broke down one year ago . __eou__ Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . __eou__ The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . __eou__ Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__ What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__ Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__ I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off .

David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? __eou__ Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__ But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__ I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__ Ok . What else ? __eou__ They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__ I see . What about the salary ? __eou__ Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__ Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__ Anytime . Let me know how it works out .
So how was your interview ? __eou__ I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . __eou__ Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ Remember , they want someone who works well with people . You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . __eou__ Thanks , I'll keep that in mind .

What job did you have in mind . __eou__ well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . __eou__ do you understand what duties that job would entail ? __eou__ yes .

Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning .

From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . __eou__ Well I ’ m impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company ’ s future can only be brighter . I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation __eou__ So you ’ Ve acquainted yourself with the company . It ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . __eou__ Yes , I believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me , not just if I ’ m right for the company .

Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? __eou__ Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . __eou__ What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? __eou__ I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes .
I ’ m ready to settle the bill . __eou__ I hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__ Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__ Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__ That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__ Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__ But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__ Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__ Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her .
Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? __eou__ I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? __eou__ The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__ What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? __eou__ That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__ I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__ Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this .
Good afternoon , Mr . Dome ’ s office . __eou__ This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr .

I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . __eou__ Great . Talk to you then .
I would like to buy a ticket to New York please . __eou__ When do you plan to travel ? __eou__ I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . __eou__ Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? __eou__ Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . __eou__ I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? __eou__ I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . __eou__ When would you like to return ? __eou__ My return date will be the 14th . __eou__ OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! __eou__ OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 __eou__ Will there be any layovers ? __eou__ No , all flights are direct . __eou__ Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? __eou__ $ 800 dollars .
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? __eou__ I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? __eou__ It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__ You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__ That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . __eou__ This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience .
We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . __eou__ OK . Let me send a memo around . __eou__ Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . __eou__ I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! __eou__ I know , it ’ s a big one .
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually !
Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? __eou__ What ’ s to get ready ? __eou__ Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? __eou__ Nope . __eou__ Have you updated your CV ?
hello ? __eou__ good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__ good morning . __eou__ the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__ oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__ she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__ is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__ she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__ any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__ Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__ I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . __eou__ I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? __eou__ that will be fine . __eou__ ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then .
how's your new job going ? __eou__ really well , thanks . __eou__ how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ how about your new co-workers ? __eou__ they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do .
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two .
Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? __eou__ Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__ Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , I appreciate that !
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__ I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__ I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__ no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__ I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__ do you speak Spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__ I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__ I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then !
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so .
How's your job search going ? __eou__ I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__ yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__ that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__ absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__ good . How about your cover letter ? __eou__ a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? __eou__ no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__ sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . __eou__ yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__ got it . I'll start right now .
I just received a phone call for an interview next week . __eou__ Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . __eou__ thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__ sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__ yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? __eou__ you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil __eou__ then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? __eou__ smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview __eou__ are there any other things I should pay attention to ? __eou__ yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression .
do you have s second ? __eou__ sure . What do you want ? __eou__ I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__ and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received __eou__ absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__ this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__ that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . __eou__ that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead
What did you do at the office today ? __eou__ I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__ What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__ The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the __eou__ I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__ I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required __eou__ It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . __eou__ I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__ Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__ You certainly had a busy day . __eou__ That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning .
How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . __eou__ yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__ yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__ congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__ thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__ no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__ yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__ that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__ I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__ yeah , I think so .
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__ So , what changed ? __eou__ Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ Wow , a real step up ! __eou__ Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . __eou__ So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__ Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , please .
Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . __eou__ Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__ Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . __eou__ What would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__ Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__ For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__ Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really __eou__ Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__ The London Weekly right . __eou__ Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . __eou__ ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? __eou__ that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s __eou__ from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__ I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . __eou__ don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . __eou__ that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . __eou__ carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . __eou__ good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . __eou__ they usually go on for ages . __eou__ I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . __eou__ I will . Enjoy your meeting !
What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th
Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ? __eou__ Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . __eou__ Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? __eou__ No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume .
Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? __eou__ I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ?

How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ?
I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . __eou__ Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? __eou__ Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice .
Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . __eou__ Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? __eou__ I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ?
when are you going to give me those brochures ? __eou__ What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . __eou__ I know , but I want to make reservations this week . __eou__ Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure .
I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . __eou__ Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? __eou__ No , I probably need to do some more research . __eou__ When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? __eou__ I think that their attitude is rather casual . __eou__ So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? __eou__ I have absolutely nothing so far . __eou__ You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? __eou__ Yes , where should we go from here ? __eou__ Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well .
Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ? __eou__ Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . __eou__ 553-2213 . Great , thanks . __eou__ No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please .
Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening . __eou__ Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? __eou__ I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . __eou__ Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? __eou__ I want to grow in my job and move ahead . __eou__ Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? __eou__ I need to stay in the area because of my family . __eou__ How much do you need to make per year ? __eou__ 75,000 per year . __eou__ Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you .
Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? __eou__ Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? __eou__ Tuesday would be good for me . __eou__ OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? __eou__ I think the afternoon would be best . __eou__ That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . __eou__ Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . __eou__ Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? __eou__ I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . __eou__ Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? __eou__ Yes , I know how to get there on my own . __eou__ Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you !
I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting . __eou__ Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? __eou__ I would like to meet on Monday . __eou__ Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? __eou__ I want to come in the morning . __eou__ I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? __eou__ Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . __eou__ Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? __eou__ I think that we should have just the sub-committee . __eou__ OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ No , I need directions , please . __eou__ Fine , we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need . See you there !
Oh , my God ! What's this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Look ! This window is open . __eou__ Did you open it before we left ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__ I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__ No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__ It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__ I locked it when I left though . __eou__ Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__ I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__ Look around . __eou__ The TV's still here . __eou__ And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__ But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__ I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ?
There's someone coming . __eou__ It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . __eou__ Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__ I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__ I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__ I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__ Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping .
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way .
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer .
Oh , sir . I lost my passport . __eou__ Do you remember when and where you last saw it ? __eou__ I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag . __eou__ Could you please tell me your passport number ? __eou__ 3448-2691- 6429-34 . __eou__ And what is the expiration date on your passport ? __eou__ Five months later . __eou__ I see . Please fill out this form . And you need to contact your embassy or consulate to report it as soon as possible .
Hello , police office ? __eou__ Yes , May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to report a case . Somebody broke into my house . __eou__ When did that happen ? __eou__ It happened in the morning . I just came home from work and found the lock broken . __eou__ Is anything lost ? __eou__ I don't know . I called the police as soon as I found the lock broken . __eou__ OK , we will send some men as soon as possible . __eou__ Please be quick . __eou__ OK , we will . What's your name and address ? __eou__ My name is Benjamin , and I live in Broad-Gate Street 2101 . __eou__ OK , got it . Please don't worry sir . We will be there soon . __eou__ Thank you very much .
May I help you ? __eou__ My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . __eou__ What dose she look like ? __eou__ She has blond hair and blue eyes . __eou__ What was she wearing ? __eou__ She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . __eou__ When did you last see her ? __eou__ I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... __eou__ How long has it been ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes .
How does the political system work in your country ? __eou__ We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__ Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__ Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . __eou__ What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__ This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__ Can any mp make a law ? __eou__ Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__ I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__ Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__ How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__ They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters .
What's the matter here ? __eou__ Somebody broke into my house in the morning . __eou__ When did you find out ? __eou__ About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . __eou__ Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__ I wonder how the burglar did it . __eou__ He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . __eou__ That's because we have a strong lock . __eou__ Probably . Let's check the inside then . __eou__ Did you find anything ? __eou__ Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . __eou__ Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . __eou__ You mean it is not created by the burglar ? __eou__ Definitely not , sir .
Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . __eou__ The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . __eou__ But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__ Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside .
How do we do timesheets here ? __eou__ They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? __eou__ Yes , I already have one . __eou__ OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? __eou__ I am kind of confused . __eou__ Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? __eou__ I'm not quite sure . __eou__ Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? __eou__ No , I have no idea what you are talking about . __eou__ It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__ Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later .
Can you help me with my timesheet ? __eou__ Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ? __eou__ No , I don't know where to find one . __eou__ Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that . __eou__ Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? __eou__ No , I don't know what that is . __eou__ OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I understand how to do this . __eou__ After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . __eou__ That was easy ! __eou__ Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on .
I need help with my timesheet . __eou__ OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ? __eou__ Yes , I have seen them . __eou__ Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I understand what to do . __eou__ You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ? __eou__ What ? Huh ? __eou__ So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? __eou__ Huh ? What ? __eou__ Just make sure you show your total , sign it , and turn it in . __eou__ I thought you said this was easy . __eou__ You are a quick learner . I don't think you'll have any trouble with this .

When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . __eou__ I will be prepared to do my presentation . __eou__ Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? __eou__ Everyone needs to be there . __eou__ That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? __eou__ I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . __eou__ OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day !

Are you hearing it ? __eou__ Yes , now what do I do ? __eou__ Well , after you dial 9 on the keypad , you should hear the tone change . __eou__ No , nothing changed . __eou__ When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? __eou__ I am trying to call my boss . __eou__ For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension .

So we are taking you into custody . __eou__ I didn't do anything . __eou__ We've found some heroin at your house . __eou__ No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . __eou__ That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . __eou__ I don't need your help , jerk . __eou__ Whatever you say .

There is a very critical debate between the presidential candidates tonight . __eou__ Do you know which channel it is on ? __eou__ Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms . __eou__ I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? __eou__ We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for . __eou__ It's not that serious . __eou__ Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ? __eou__ You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you .
It's a lot of work running a campaign , isn't it ! __eou__ I had no idea when I volunteered to assist governor Brown with this campaign what I was getting myself into . __eou__ Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over . __eou__ How Ay years have you been working with him ? __eou__ About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes . __eou__ It's easier doing this kind hard work when I know that I trust the man behind the posters . __eou__ Did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential campaign ? __eou__ He would be good .

If you get caught making false statements , you can have your claim closed .

Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ? __eou__ That ’ s out for me . I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a . m . How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 __eou__ That ’ s all right for my department . I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel .
Paul ? I need to work out a time to get together with your people . __eou__ Does everybody need to be there ? Hilary and Jason are on vacation this week . __eou__ It would be best if everybody could be there . How about next week sometime ? __eou__ Let me take a look at the schedule . I ’ ll get back to you this afternoon , all right ?
Let ’ s meet before next week ’ s meeting , Jane . I want to kick around some ideas with you . __eou__ No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me . __eou__ Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ? __eou__ All right , I ’ ll put you in my book .
Well , I ’ m glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I ’ m really not in a position to make a decision right now . __eou__ Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? __eou__ Yeah , why don ’ t you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week . __eou__ Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . I ’ ll talk to you next week .
Susan ? We ’ re having a farewell party for John Anderson today . __eou__ What time ? I ’ d like to go , but my calendar is really full today . __eou__ We ’ re starting at 12:00 and it ’ ll go on for the rest of the afternoon . __eou__ I ’ ll try to make it . I should be able to fit some time in around 3 o ’ clock .
Grant . How is everything ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . We ’ Ve just been incredibly busy ! I need to set up a meeting for Mr . Graham . __eou__ Sure . What ’ s it about ? __eou__ He wants to go over the bonuses for this year . He ’ ll need to meet with Mr . Winthrop and Ms . Montgomery . Can you set it up for me ?
Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . __eou__ Yeah ? What does he want ? __eou__ He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting . __eou__ I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ?
John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . __eou__ That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! __eou__ I understand , Ms . Fairbanks .
Why are you in court today ? __eou__ I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . __eou__ Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? __eou__ He's here . __eou__ Tell me what happened . __eou__ The officer says that I ran a red light , but I didn't . __eou__ The officer wouldn't lie about that . __eou__ He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . __eou__ There was no picture taken of your license plate ? __eou__ I don't believe it took my picture . __eou__ I'm just going to let you go . __eou__ I appreciate that .
how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help .
What's going on here ? __eou__ You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . __eou__ Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? __eou__ Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time . __eou__ Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ? __eou__ No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . __eou__ Is he at home ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment .
Did you hear anything about the robbery ? __eou__ I watched it happen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . I was right there . __eou__ What did you see ? __eou__ This guy tried to rob the bank . __eou__ I can't believe it . __eou__ I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . __eou__ What happened next ? __eou__ He tried to leave with the money . __eou__ Did he get caught ? __eou__ They caught him before he could walk through the front door .
How may I help you ? __eou__ I would like you to be my lawyer . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I ’ m going on trial . __eou__ What is your trial about ? __eou__ It ’ s a felony charge . __eou__ I ’ d be glad to help . __eou__ How much do you charge ? __eou__ My rate is $ 150 an hour . __eou__ That ’ s highway robbery . __eou__ I don ’ t know what to tell you . __eou__ Okay . You ’ re hired .
Could I speak to you for a minute ? __eou__ What do you want to speak to me about ? __eou__ I want to talk about this year ’ s election . __eou__ Oh , you do ? __eou__ I am volunteering for the campaign . __eou__ What made you decide to volunteer ? __eou__ I want to be a part of history . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ Do you plan on voting ? __eou__ I will be voting . __eou__ You should try and make it early to your polling place . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know .
Did you need help ? __eou__ Where do I go to pick up my ballot ? __eou__ I ’ ll help you with that . __eou__ How ’ s that ? __eou__ I ’ m working here today . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . __eou__ Can I see your ID , please ? __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ I have your ballot card right here . __eou__ What am I supposed to do now ? __eou__ All you have to do now is vote . __eou__ Okay . Wish me luck .
Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you offer a safety deposit box rental service here ? __eou__ We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? __eou__ I'd like to put some valuables inside , you know , documents and jewellery , things like that . __eou__ I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ? __eou__ What rental do you offer ? __eou__ You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . __eou__ I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help .
Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ? __eou__ Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office . __eou__ We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box . __eou__ I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . __eou__ You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . __eou__ That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . __eou__ If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . __eou__ OK , I'll take a small , for 1 year , in this branch , please .
Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ? __eou__ I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please . __eou__ That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you . __eou__ You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . __eou__ Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? __eou__ Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . __eou__ Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful . __eou__ That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks .
Hello , Lincoln Bank . Kristy speaking , how may I help you today ? __eou__ Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ? __eou__ I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? __eou__ The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too . __eou__ OK ... and what deposit do I need ? I mean , is there a minimum deposit ? __eou__ You'll need to deposit 1,500 RIB initially . There will also be some small additional charges for this service . __eou__ That's no problem . How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ? __eou__ It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents . __eou__ Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye .
Good afternoon . Can I help you ? __eou__ Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . __eou__ Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir . __eou__ Do you need anything else from me ? __eou__ We do require a deposit before we can issue you with a personal credit card . __eou__ No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some . __eou__ The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well . __eou__ I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are .
Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ? __eou__ I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . __eou__ Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? __eou__ That might be a good idea , yes . __eou__ Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? __eou__ I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . __eou__ Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? __eou__ No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me .
Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need some advice about my fixed deposits . __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . __eou__ I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? __eou__ Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . __eou__ Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? __eou__ Yes ... __eou__ You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . __eou__ That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in .
Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ? __eou__ Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? __eou__ Of course . As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . __eou__ I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? __eou__ There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . __eou__ Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? __eou__ There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... __eou__ The list goes on and on ! __eou__ Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . __eou__ So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank .
Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . __eou__ What can I help you with ? __eou__ I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? __eou__ Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? __eou__ Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? __eou__ Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . __eou__ How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? __eou__ Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . __eou__ Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ...
Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? __eou__ Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . __eou__ That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . __eou__ I need to have a credit check done for my company . __eou__ If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . __eou__ That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? __eou__ There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? __eou__ Great . I'll wait right here , thanks .
Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? __eou__ I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__ Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . __eou__ That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . __eou__ I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? __eou__ Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % __eou__ So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? __eou__ We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__ That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time .
Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? __eou__ My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__ That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . __eou__ Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__ What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__ Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__ Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__ What do you require ? __eou__ A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got .
Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? __eou__ I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__ Are you an existing customer ? __eou__ Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__ May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__ When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__ That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__ As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that .
Credit Services , how can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__ Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? __eou__ Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . __eou__ Why such a big difference ? __eou__ It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__ My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__ Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__ That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire .
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? __eou__ Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__ Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__ Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__ You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__ So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? __eou__ Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . __eou__ Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that .
Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . __eou__ Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . __eou__ And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . __eou__ If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . __eou__ In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver .
It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__ I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? __eou__ Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__ I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__ That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__ The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__ We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__ That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started .
Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? __eou__ I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . __eou__ We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . __eou__ Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . __eou__ 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__ I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? __eou__ I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . __eou__ I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then .
Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? __eou__ Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . __eou__ This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__ That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . __eou__ That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . __eou__ Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? __eou__ May I have your details , and I'll check for you . __eou__ Certainly ... __eou__ OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__ Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those .
Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... __eou__ Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . __eou__ And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . __eou__ Check , check and check . __eou__ What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? __eou__ Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? __eou__ As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . __eou__ No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account .
Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . __eou__ I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? __eou__ Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? __eou__ That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . __eou__ Could I open an account with you today ? __eou__ Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . __eou__ Yes , here you go . And sign here ? __eou__ Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . __eou__ So quick and easy ! Thanks very much .
How can I help you this afternoon ? __eou__ I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . __eou__ Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . __eou__ Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon . __eou__ You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? __eou__ I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . __eou__ Thank you . And you require ... __eou__ 800 RIB , please . __eou__ Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please . __eou__ OK ... __eou__ Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me . __eou__ Yes , that's great . Thanks .
Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . __eou__ No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? __eou__ Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__ Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . We will be putting in a new ATM in the near future , though . That should help to ease the queues . __eou__ I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . __eou__ I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? __eou__ 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . __eou__ That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? __eou__ OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . __eou__ It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? __eou__ That's fine . OK . Thanks .
Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? __eou__ I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? __eou__ Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? __eou__ Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! __eou__ That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . __eou__ Fine . Here you go . __eou__ How much would you like to withdraw ? __eou__ Is it OK to withdraw USD ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ OK , 200 USD , please . __eou__ Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . __eou__ Perfect . Thanks !

What can I help you with , Sir ? __eou__ I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? __eou__ Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . __eou__ A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . __eou__ No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? __eou__ A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks .
May I help you at all ? __eou__ Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? __eou__ We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__ I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__ This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__ So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__ That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__ That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you .
Good day ! What can we do for you ? __eou__ I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__ Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__ That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__ With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__ That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__ That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__ The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it .
Personal Loans , how may I help ? __eou__ I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . __eou__ Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply __eou__ Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? __eou__ Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . __eou__ I see . What about age limitations ? __eou__ There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . __eou__ Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much .
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . __eou__ OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__ Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? __eou__ You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__ Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__ Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__ OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks .

I am really excited ! __eou__ Why are you so excited ? __eou__ I just got done voting . __eou__ This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ I just turned 18 last month . __eou__ That is so lucky of you . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You turned 18 a month before the election . __eou__ I didn ’ t think of it that way . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . __eou__ Congratulations on being a part of history .
I am so excited ! __eou__ Excited about what ? __eou__ I just voted . __eou__ Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ? __eou__ Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . __eou__ That ’ s lucky . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ You turned 18 in an election year . __eou__ I didn ’ t think about it like that . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ No , but that makes me even more excited . __eou__ You ’ re a part of history .
Did you vote ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__ Who was your vote for President ? __eou__ My vote was for Barack Obama . __eou__ I didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__ I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__ What made you think that ? __eou__ Nobody could compete with him . __eou__ I thought his race would have kept him from winning . __eou__ Times are changing . __eou__ That ’ s true . __eou__ I support our new President 100 % .
National Trust . __eou__ My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . __eou__ Just one second , and I'll check . __eou__ Thank you .

You voted , right ? __eou__ You know I did . __eou__ Who did you vote for ? __eou__ I voted for Obama , of course ! __eou__ Can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__ I knew he would win . __eou__ I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__ He was the top candidate . __eou__ I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . __eou__ That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President .

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Which service do you require today ? __eou__ I'm here to ask about a loan . __eou__ We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ? __eou__ I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . __eou__ I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans . __eou__ Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? __eou__ Certainly . It's quite simple really . Do you hold a resident's permit ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I was born and bred here . __eou__ That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation . __eou__ I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years .
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Are you a new customer ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . __eou__ I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . __eou__ Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . __eou__ May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? __eou__ Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . __eou__ We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . __eou__ I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice .
As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? __eou__ That's right . Here you go . __eou__ Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... __eou__ OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . __eou__ You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . __eou__ That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__ We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__ How soon before this goes through ? __eou__ If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . __eou__ Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything .
Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ? __eou__ It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . __eou__ OK , Madam . We are here to help . __eou__ I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__ I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . __eou__ I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? __eou__ The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . __eou__ Right ... anything else ? __eou__ Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . __eou__ And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient .
Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? __eou__ Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__ Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? __eou__ I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . __eou__ I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? __eou__ It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions . __eou__ Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . __eou__ I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . __eou__ Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign .
Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? __eou__ Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__ I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__ One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__ So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? __eou__ That is correct . __eou__ I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now .

Mr Moon , how good to see you again . __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__ Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__ What if I exceed ? __eou__ If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__ Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do .
After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . __eou__ Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? __eou__ It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . __eou__ So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? __eou__ First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . __eou__ OK , let's get the ball rolling on this .
Hi , how can I help ? __eou__ I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . __eou__ Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . __eou__ Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? __eou__ Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . __eou__ Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done .
Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? __eou__ No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . __eou__ You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? __eou__ That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . __eou__ Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? __eou__ Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . __eou__ This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? __eou__ No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it .
Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ? __eou__ I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . __eou__ OK Sir .

The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . __eou__ OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . __eou__ OK , it's 672910 .
Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? __eou__ Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . __eou__ I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from __eou__ Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? __eou__ Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? __eou__ Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account .
Good morning , Sir . __eou__ Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? __eou__ Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? __eou__ 10,000 Japanese yen . __eou__ OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? __eou__ Fixed . __eou__ And how long are you depositing for ? __eou__ For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know .
Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . __eou__ OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . __eou__ I see . What's the interest like on those ? __eou__ There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . __eou__ Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is !

But I'm not sure how long I should save for . __eou__ Well , we offer 5 grades as standard __eou__ Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? __eou__ For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . __eou__ That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go .

I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ? __eou__ That would be wonderful . __eou__ We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world .

What would happen to my money ? __eou__ As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly .

Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? __eou__ I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates .

Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__ Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . __eou__ So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? __eou__ Technically , yes . __eou__ OK , I think I've got it .

This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . __eou__ So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street !

The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? __eou__ Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? __eou__ Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . __eou__ That's a great idea ; thanks for your help .

I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? __eou__ Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... __eou__ Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . __eou__ The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . __eou__ That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem .
Welcome to IBA . How can I help you ? __eou__ You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived ? It's Ming Cha Legal Services . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 . __eou__ JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? __eou__ Correct . Could I convert that into RIB ? __eou__ Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . __eou__ That's fine , thanks .
Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? __eou__ I am indeed . What can you tell me ? __eou__ The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . __eou__ Do I get a card ? __eou__ Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . __eou__ How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . __eou__ The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . __eou__ That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? __eou__ Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . __eou__ That's wonderful .
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__ The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__ Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__ That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ Wow ! A third more ? Very good .
Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ? __eou__ Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ?

It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . __eou__ Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program . __eou__ What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all . __eou__ For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both . __eou__ That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful .

I mean is it possible to still use the service ? __eou__ That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time . __eou__ Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? __eou__ Of course . It's 33234 .

Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? __eou__ Sure . At present one dollar is equal to 6.4392 yuan . How many dollars would you like to change ? __eou__ 500 dollars , please . __eou__ Please wait for a moment ... Now here is your Chinese currency . See if it's right . It's 3,220 yuan . Please keep this exchange memo . You may need it for converting when you leave China . __eou__ OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . __eou__ It's my pleasure .
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation . __eou__ You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . __eou__ I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week . __eou__ OK . __eou__ I will give a call .
What else , Ma'am ? __eou__ No , thanks . My husband said , We'd like to pay now . __eou__ Let me show you to the cashier's . It's 905 yuan in total . __eou__ What ? Where does that five come from ? __eou__ Oh , it's a service charge . __eou__ But I only have 900 in cash here . Can you let it go for 900 yuan ? __eou__ Sorry , but we can't do that . It's store's rule . __eou__ My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Great . Here it is . __eou__ Here is the receipt . Wanna to have it wrapped , Ma'am ? __eou__ Yes , please . Thank you very much . __eou__ It'll be great to have you again . __eou__ Thank you very much .

Good morning . May I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes . I want to make a remittance to New Delhi . __eou__ Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ? __eou__ I'd like a banker's draft please . It's not really urgent .
Good morning , may I help you ? __eou__ Hello , I want to remit one thousand Yuan to Magnolia Company . __eou__ Please fill out this form , please . __eou__ OK ... Do I put on Magnolia Company for the receiver ? __eou__ Yes . You must put on its name and full address . __eou__ OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ? __eou__ Let me check . Yes . Your one thousand remittance , please . __eou__ Here you are . What is the rate ? __eou__ This rate is one percent . That will be 10 Yuan . __eou__ OK , when will this remittance arrive ? __eou__ Generally it will arrive within a week . __eou__ That's good . Is there anything else ? __eou__ No . That's all . You have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . __eou__ Thanks , I will .
Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? __eou__ Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . __eou__ I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . __eou__ We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . __eou__ Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . __eou__ All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . __eou__ That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? __eou__ We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . __eou__ I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__ Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . __eou__ Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? __eou__ Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__ Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . __eou__ All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly .
Good Morning , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__ How much do you want to change ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the rate today ? __eou__ It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB . __eou__ What was the rate yesterday ? __eou__ The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . __eou__ Oh , the rate goes down . __eou__ It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? __eou__ Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? __eou__ I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . __eou__ Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__ Okay . Please sign here in this form . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Here is the 6,100 RIB . __eou__ Thank you very much .
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? __eou__ Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__ I will think about it .
Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? __eou__ I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . __eou__ Wow , you sound very professional . __eou__ I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner .
I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . __eou__ Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__ I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__ All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__ Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . __eou__ We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__ Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__ The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__ As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__ Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__ 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__ I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__ It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow .
I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . __eou__ I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__ We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__ Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__ That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__ Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis .
I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__ I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__ I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__ Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . __eou__ Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__ Sure , no problem .
Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? __eou__ No . These terms need to be amplified . __eou__ What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? __eou__ Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . __eou__ Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__ Yes , that's very important .
I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . __eou__ As a rule , we don't allow any discount . __eou__ But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . __eou__ That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts .
I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . __eou__ I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . __eou__ Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . __eou__ As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . __eou__ Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? __eou__ By the coming September . __eou__ Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? __eou__ Certainly !
Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . __eou__ We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . __eou__ Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? __eou__ We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ Wonderful .
Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? __eou__ In April or early May . __eou__ I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . __eou__ In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . __eou__ You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . __eou__ All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April .
We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . __eou__ How much would you like ? __eou__ 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . __eou__ A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . __eou__ The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . __eou__ Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % .
I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . __eou__ Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__ But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__ That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__ But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__ But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__ But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__ I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care .
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help .
Welcome to China , Mr . White . __eou__ How do you do , Ms . Chi ? __eou__ Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . __eou__ Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . __eou__ Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . __eou__ I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . __eou__ Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . __eou__ Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ? __eou__ We normally export CFR . __eou__ What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis . __eou__ That can be discussed . __eou__ All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ? __eou__ What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel . __eou__ I'll be expecting you , then .
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . __eou__ That's right . Let's go into the details . __eou__ Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__ Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? __eou__ But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . __eou__ Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . __eou__ As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . __eou__ If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . __eou__ I am sorry . __eou__ What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . __eou__ All right . I'll take you at your word . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . __eou__ I promise .
Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? __eou__ Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . __eou__ Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . __eou__ You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders .
What kind of document is an invoice ? __eou__ It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . __eou__ How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? __eou__ Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . __eou__ What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? __eou__ By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . __eou__ Oh , I see .
Hello ! How can I help you , sir ? __eou__ I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? __eou__ Do you qualify for any of the Federal loan programs ? __eou__ Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . __eou__ Well . In that case we can offer you a private educational loan . __eou__ What's the interest rate ? __eou__ It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . __eou__ How do I go about taking it out ? __eou__ Just fill out this application . We can let you know right away if you qualify . __eou__ All right , thank you !
Hello , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__ Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__ Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__ You mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__ No , madam . Not very much . __eou__ Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . __eou__ Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__ Ok .
How large is the plant ? __eou__ It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__ It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__ In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__ 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__ Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__ Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__ That ’ s fine .
I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__ Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__ You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good .
How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__ We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__ That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__ Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__ Is that including tax ? __eou__ No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__ How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__ Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % .
So how did I do ? __eou__ Not too good , I'm sorry . __eou__ I lost ? __eou__ It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__ So the price was good ? __eou__ Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__ So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__ No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . __eou__ I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . __eou__ That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit .
How much will our order from your factory be ? __eou__ I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? __eou__ Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? __eou__ Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__ Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__ Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__ Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out .
Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? __eou__ We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__ Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? __eou__ I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__ I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... __eou__ I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try .
Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . __eou__ Than you , I'm not late , am I ? __eou__ No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__ Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__ Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? __eou__ Please , I wish you would . __eou__ Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__ Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__ I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . __eou__ That's pretty much what I heard . __eou__ Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? __eou__ No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance .
Sandrawu Chunk International . __eou__ Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? __eou__ I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? __eou__ Sure . No problem . __eou__ Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? __eou__ Sure . Do you have my number ? __eou__ Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__ No problem . I'll wait for your call .
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? __eou__ Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . __eou__ Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__ It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__ A company account . I need to pay a bill . __eou__ Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__ I have all the information in this folder . __eou__ Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure .
We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__ Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__ But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__ It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__ How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__ Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__ $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__ It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__ Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__ No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it .
We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__ Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__ Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__ No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__ So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__ Great !
That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . __eou__ Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__ I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__ Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__ What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? __eou__ If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? __eou__ Yes .
Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? __eou__ China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation __eou__ We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable __eou__ Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent __eou__ Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? __eou__ It depends on how much you order __eou__ Can I use the FAS terms ? __eou__ I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract .
Do you think I should turn down his offer ? __eou__ Yes , it's the correct thing to do . __eou__ But we may not get another partner . __eou__ Even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable .
What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? __eou__ Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . __eou__ Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? __eou__ Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . __eou__ What kind of change , just in prices ? __eou__ No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . __eou__ You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? __eou__ No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . __eou__ So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . __eou__ I think we'll get along fine .
Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? __eou__ We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . __eou__ To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . __eou__ Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . __eou__ To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? __eou__ I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C .
Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? __eou__ Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? __eou__ Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__ We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . __eou__ I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? __eou__ Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . __eou__ Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? __eou__ It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? __eou__ Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . __eou__ Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon .
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? __eou__ That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__ Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__ Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__ As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Carton ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__ Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__ All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__ You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__ That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__ Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__ No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? __eou__ Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__ Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__ Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__ Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . __eou__ Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__ Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__ Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__ That's fine too .
Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? __eou__ Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . __eou__ I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__ Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__ Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? __eou__ Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__ I see .
Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__ Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__ That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__ Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__ All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand .
That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__ Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__ 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__ Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__ Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__ Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__ All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__ Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__ Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__ That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__ Thanks .
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products .
Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__ Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__ Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__ Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ What about the outer packing ? __eou__ We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Cartons ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__ The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__ Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__ No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__ Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__ Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__ Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__ But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__ If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__ I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__ We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__ Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__ Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply .
Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? __eou__ I don't think we can . __eou__ Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__ By the middle of October , I think . __eou__ That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__ But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__ Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__ I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__ That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__ You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__ But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__ All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say .
It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . __eou__ And that is ? __eou__ How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? __eou__ I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . __eou__ It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__ I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? __eou__ Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__ Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . __eou__ It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? __eou__ We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April .
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways !
Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . __eou__ Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? __eou__ I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__ I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__ I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__ Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__ In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__ It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__ Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__ If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__ It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__ We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__ If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__ That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that

I like to have easy access to my money . __eou__ Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . __eou__ No , that won ’ t be necessary . __eou__ In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork .

Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival .

It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__ Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__ Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__ Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . __eou__ Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did .
I've got some great news for you ! __eou__ did you get the position you wanted ? __eou__ yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__ thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__ sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader . __eou__ I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon . __eou__ that's very nice of you to say so . I'll try my best . When will you start at the new position ? __eou__ next week . __eou__ so by then , you'll be in charge of the whole department . __eou__ absolutely .
During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . __eou__ If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . __eou__ If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? __eou__ The insurance policy protects us . __eou__ Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? __eou__ It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing .

Call back if you have any more questions .
I was inquiring about a bill that I never got . __eou__ Which credit card was the bill for ? __eou__ The bill was for my Master Card . __eou__ That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago . __eou__ It never came in the mail . __eou__ My computer shows that it has already been mailed . __eou__ I have not gotten my bill , so what should I do about that ? __eou__ You should try contacting your post office . __eou__ If it is the post office's fault , may I have an extension on my bill ? __eou__ You'll have to prove it was their error ; then you can get an extension . __eou__ Thank you for all your help . __eou__ You are very welcome . Have a good day .

Hey honey , how was your day ? __eou__ It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__ Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__ Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__ Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . __eou__ I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__ Not in a million years !
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__ There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company !

Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways !

And you know the exchange rate . __eou__ Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? __eou__ Not today . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__ Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__ I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__ Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__ So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__ That's amazing ! Really ?

I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__ So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try .

Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c __eou__ What are you basing this information on ? __eou__ First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . __eou__ Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . __eou__ I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . __eou__ Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately .
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White .

This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__ My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction .
You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . __eou__ I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . __eou__ As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . __eou__ Does this title come with an increase in salary ? __eou__ Yes , it does . __eou__ Can you give me the specifics ? __eou__ Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 . __eou__ That sounds fair .
Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference .

May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? __eou__ Are you going to make an offer today ? __eou__ Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . __eou__ Ok , I'll get this rate right away . __eou__ Thank you .
