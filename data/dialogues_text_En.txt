The kitchen stinks . __eou__ I'll throw out the garbage .
Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? __eou__ Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed .
Would you mind waiting a while ? __eou__ Well , how long will it be ? __eou__ I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . __eou__ OK . We'll wait .
Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ? __eou__ Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak .

But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before . __eou__ I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive . __eou__ Then I doubt if you like operas at all . __eou__ Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one . __eou__ OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave . __eou__ Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice . __eou__ Me , too .

How would you like to earn the other half ? __eou__ Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ? __eou__ I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned .
We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . __eou__ Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? __eou__ Some high speed chase scene , I think . __eou__ I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . __eou__ I think that they get a pretty good payoff . __eou__ The movie company has to pay them ? __eou__ I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! __eou__ Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see !

Hey , Mom , look what I found ! __eou__ Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house .
What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . __eou__ And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now !
It's time to go . Are you ready ? __eou__ Almost . Let me get my bag .
How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? __eou__ It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? __eou__ I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! __eou__ All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . __eou__ That will be my pleasure .
Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? __eou__ You don't know what you are asking ! __eou__ Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . __eou__ Remember what happened last time ? __eou__ Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? __eou__ Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . __eou__ Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! __eou__ Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ?
Hello . Welcome ! __eou__ Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . __eou__ This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here .

Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? __eou__ No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though . __eou__ I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? __eou__ It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . __eou__ A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . __eou__ I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up . __eou__ Oooo . This sounds serious . __eou__ Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down .
Are you ready to order yet , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . __eou__ Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . __eou__ Ok .

Wait till the guys hear about this ! __eou__ Mike , don't even think about it !
Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . __eou__ I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous . __eou__ Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__ I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming . __eou__ I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive . __eou__ You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea .
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? __eou__ Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . __eou__ It's too expensive . __eou__ If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . __eou__ What's the difference between the two ? __eou__ It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . __eou__ Let me see .
Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ? __eou__ It costs only 25 yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ? __eou__ The price is reasonable because the quality is super . __eou__ But the price is too high . __eou__ How much would you like it to be , then ? __eou__ What about 15 yuan ? __eou__ Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ? __eou__ All right , I'll take it . __eou__ I think you've got a real bargain . __eou__ Thank you .
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? __eou__ There's some leftover pizza from last night . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . __eou__ Do I have any other choices ? __eou__ There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . __eou__ Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! __eou__ You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner !
This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . __eou__ I didn't know you did Yoga . __eou__ I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . __eou__ What have you learned ? __eou__ Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . __eou__ As opposed to short and shallow ? __eou__ Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' __eou__ I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . '
Good evening , madam . May I help you ? __eou__ I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? __eou__ Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . __eou__ That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? __eou__ We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . __eou__ What's the regular price ? __eou__ Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . __eou__ Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . __eou__ That's fine , madam . __eou__ By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . __eou__ Yes , madam .
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ Well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__ Turn on the TV , for what ? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__ I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . __eou__ Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . __eou__ I can try to arrange that for you . __eou__ I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . __eou__ Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? __eou__ It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . __eou__ You're in luck . We still have that little table .
The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . __eou__ Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? __eou__ Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! __eou__ So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... __eou__ Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . __eou__ That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? __eou__ Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! __eou__ I see what you mean !
I've never been to a restaurant like this before . __eou__ It's really different , isn't it ? __eou__ That's a good word to describe it . __eou__ I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . __eou__ I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . __eou__ Well , let's order one for starters . __eou__ I'm in the mood for a Californian . __eou__ That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order .
Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ? __eou__ We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work . __eou__ Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work ! __eou__ It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company . __eou__ Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ? __eou__ You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car . __eou__ Jeans and a tee shirt , right ? __eou__ Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool .
What can I get for you today , sir ? __eou__ I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar . __eou__ Would you like anything else with that ? __eou__ How fresh is that apple pie over there ? __eou__ Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious . __eou__ Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then . __eou__ Is this to stay or to go ? __eou__ I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking .
Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ I don't know how to say it in English . __eou__ We call this a ' parking meter ' . __eou__ Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ? __eou__ P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r .
Would you mind giving me a hand ? __eou__ Okay , Bob , What is it ? __eou__ Help me hang up this picture , please .

Tell me if I've got it straight . __eou__ Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid .
Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? __eou__ You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? __eou__ Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . __eou__ I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . __eou__ And after that ? __eou__ After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle .
Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . __eou__ No kidding ! When did that happen ? __eou__ Early this morning . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . __eou__ Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? __eou__ The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . __eou__ That's amazingly low for such a huge accident !
Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . __eou__ Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? __eou__ I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw . __eou__ Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? __eou__ No , not really , there's just a lot of blood . __eou__ You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . __eou__ I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk . __eou__ Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there .

Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? __eou__ Everything about them was different , even the theaters . __eou__ I'm really interested . Tell me about them . __eou__ Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . __eou__ That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . __eou__ We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . __eou__ Why don't we do that anymore ? __eou__ Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot .
I'm going crazy . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately . __eou__ Well , if there is anything I can do to help , let me know .
Chinese tea is famous all over the world . I want to buy several boxes . __eou__ There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect . __eou__ Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all . __eou__ This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . __eou__ Sounds interesting . What about this ? __eou__ It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . __eou__ What's this ? It smells fragrant . __eou__ It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . __eou__ I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend . __eou__ No problem . Wait for a moment .
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? __eou__ Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . __eou__ Moon cakes ? What is that ? __eou__ The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . __eou__ Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . __eou__ All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . __eou__ What's the difference between these two styles ? __eou__ The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . __eou__ Get me some of each . __eou__ OK , here you are .
Ann , it's terrible ! __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ Look , this is a pimple ! __eou__ Oh , I think it is . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I think it's because of your bad habits ! __eou__ I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . __eou__ I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . __eou__ I wasn't aware of that ! __eou__ You should do better later .
Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded . __eou__ Sure .

What is this big box at the front door ? __eou__ Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . __eou__ What did you get yourself into ? __eou__ I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months . __eou__ So , what's in the box ? A fridge ? __eou__ It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . __eou__ I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! __eou__ Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ?
How can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend . __eou__ Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? __eou__ She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . __eou__ OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes . __eou__ Which one would you recommend ? __eou__ Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? __eou__ That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . __eou__ Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__ It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy . __eou__ How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick . __eou__ She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . __eou__ How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . __eou__ No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . __eou__ I know what she would like-some whitening cream . __eou__ No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter . __eou__ Will that be all then ? __eou__ That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks .
What did you buy at the market ? __eou__ I bought some special local products . __eou__ You seem to have bought the whole market ! __eou__ Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . __eou__ Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . __eou__ Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? __eou__ All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . __eou__ Then I will buy some tomorrow . __eou__ Why do you want to buy so much ? __eou__ Because I want to send them to my friends . __eou__ I see .
Are there pets allowed in this apartment ? __eou__ No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed . __eou__ What about a boa constrictor ? __eou__ Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ? __eou__ If I had one , could I rent this apartment ? __eou__ I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock . __eou__ What about a Gila monster ? __eou__ I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here .
Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . __eou__ Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? __eou__ I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one . __eou__ You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ? __eou__ I know , I know . I will do it all by myself . __eou__ Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? __eou__ Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . __eou__ Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this .
I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ? __eou__ Sure . Let's buy it .
Help ! I'm about to drop these books . __eou__ I've got them . __eou__ Thanks !
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ? __eou__ I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? __eou__ It's not special . It can be seen everywhere . __eou__ How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . __eou__ It's interesting . Let me see . __eou__ Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , how much is it ? __eou__ Fifty yuan . __eou__ OK , I'll take it .
Where are you going , Tony ? __eou__ It's none of your business . __eou__ Mom said you couldn't go out . __eou__ I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way .
Has someone already helped you ? __eou__ No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot . __eou__ Which do you like best ? __eou__ That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? __eou__ 360 yuan . __eou__ Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here . __eou__ Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock . __eou__ I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? __eou__ I can give you a 10 % discount . __eou__ That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ? __eou__ I'm afraid that's the best we can do . __eou__ If so , I'd better try another store .
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Can I have a look at your handworks ? __eou__ All right . This way , please . __eou__ You have quite a range , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__ They are all produced in China , aren't they ? __eou__ Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . __eou__ Could you please select me one ? __eou__ How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . __eou__ Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? __eou__ 350 yuan . __eou__ OK . I'll take it .
Dad , do you know where Mom is ? __eou__ I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . __eou__ She'd better not start crying like she usually does . __eou__ I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? __eou__ Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . __eou__ I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . __eou__ That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . __eou__ We have great confidence in you .
Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! __eou__ That is a blast from the past . __eou__ Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ? __eou__ Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . __eou__ Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . __eou__ But what are you going to do with that pig ? __eou__ I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money . __eou__ Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation !
Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . __eou__ It still feels really strange to me . __eou__ I know . I miss him terribly . __eou__ How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? __eou__ I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . __eou__ I guess you could choose that if you wanted . __eou__ No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . __eou__ Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone !
We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food . __eou__ Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . __eou__ What should we buy ? __eou__ Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . __eou__ It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . __eou__ How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . __eou__ Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . __eou__ Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? __eou__ That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . __eou__ Definitely beer . Two bottles . __eou__ Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . __eou__ Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . __eou__ OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . __eou__ Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines .
Can I help you ? __eou__ I need some stamps . __eou__ What kind of stamps do you want ? __eou__ How much do I need for this letter ? __eou__ I must weigh it . __eou__ How much ? Is it overweight ? __eou__ It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ? __eou__ How much is it , then ? __eou__ Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all . __eou__ OK . Here you are .
Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? __eou__ Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . __eou__ Wow . You look great . __eou__ Thanks for noticing . __eou__ What type of diet were you on ? __eou__ I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . __eou__ That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? __eou__ Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . __eou__ That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? __eou__ Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . __eou__ That makes sense . I'm going to try that . __eou__ You don't need to lose weight . __eou__ I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . __eou__ Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . __eou__ No problem .
Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? __eou__ I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . __eou__ He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . __eou__ Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . __eou__ How do you propose to help him understand that ? __eou__ Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . __eou__ I guess we could go visit once in a while too . __eou__ Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition .
Oops ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I overcooked the corn . __eou__ That's okay . I like it better that way anyway .
Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . __eou__ No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? __eou__ I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? __eou__ That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . __eou__ He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . __eou__ Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . __eou__ You're glad he saved me , huh ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time !
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . __eou__ Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . __eou__ Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . __eou__ That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . __eou__ What do you know ? You are over weight too . __eou__ I'm not on a diet though . __eou__ I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . __eou__ I like ice cream too much though . __eou__ C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . __eou__ It does sound appealing . __eou__ It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . __eou__ Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . __eou__ Great . I'll get our plan started right away . __eou__ Can we start tomorrow though ?
I need to buy some fruit . __eou__ All the fruit are pretty fresh here . __eou__ How much are the pears ? __eou__ They're four yuan per kilo . __eou__ Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ? __eou__ Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo . __eou__ It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . __eou__ Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . __eou__ OK . It's 22 yuan __eou__ Here you are .
I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . __eou__ Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . __eou__ What's the brand ? __eou__ San Yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? __eou__ I'm not used to other brands . __eou__ You can have a try . Maybe you will like it . __eou__ OK . I hope so .
Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? __eou__ Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . __eou__ Which brand are you interested in ? __eou__ I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? __eou__ Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? __eou__ It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . __eou__ How about Flymo ? It's selling well . __eou__ Do you have a warranty on it ? __eou__ Of course . The warranty period is one year . __eou__ If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? __eou__ Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . __eou__ OK . I'll take one .
Lucy , where are you going ? __eou__ I want to go to the supermarket . __eou__ Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you . __eou__ Let's get a shopping cart . __eou__ Good idea __eou__ What are you going to buy ? __eou__ Let's check out the fruit section first . __eou__ OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet . __eou__ Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . __eou__ I'll take some , too . __eou__ Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets . __eou__ OK . I'll go and buy some cakes . __eou__ Do you want to buy something else ? __eou__ No . Let's go over to the check-out stand .
Mom , I finished . __eou__ OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . __eou__ OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink . __eou__ Thank you . I'll wash them . __eou__ OK . Then I will clean the table . __eou__ Good boy .
I had a busy morning . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I watered all the plants . __eou__ You have a lot of plants . __eou__ Then I did my laundry . __eou__ That takes some time . __eou__ I took the dog for a walk . __eou__ I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . __eou__ I vacuumed the entire house . __eou__ That's a lot of work . __eou__ And then I made lunch . __eou__ I'll bet you were hungry !
My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? __eou__ Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . __eou__ I wish my parents were a little more lenient . __eou__ I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . __eou__ You like going to bed early ? __eou__ I don't like being too tired the next day . __eou__ Well , I still hate having a curfew . __eou__ If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway .
I found a great school for Junior ! __eou__ Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet ! __eou__ We can't be too cautious about these things . __eou__ You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school . __eou__ There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook ! __eou__ What about inside the school ? __eou__ There is a library right inside the front door . __eou__ I think our child is going to love it !
What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? __eou__ We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . __eou__ I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . __eou__ You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours . __eou__ I think she is really going to like her teacher though . __eou__ Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day . __eou__ Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ? __eou__ No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies !
Tom , it's time for you to take a shower . __eou__ Mom , I don't want to bathe today . __eou__ Why ? You can't be always so lazy . __eou__ Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . __eou__ Alright . But you promise this is the last time . __eou__ OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom .

There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . __eou__ You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . __eou__ But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . __eou__ To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue .

We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work .

Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ? __eou__ Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now . __eou__ Do you think any studios will open up soon ? __eou__ No , not for a few months .
What kind of lease is it ? __eou__ It's a one-year lease . __eou__ Can I have a month-to-month lease ? I only want to rent the apartment for five months . __eou__ No , all the leases are for one year . We don't have month-to-month leases . __eou__ Well , then I don't think this would be a good apartment for me . Thank you anyway . __eou__ You're welcome .
Are utilities included in the rent ? __eou__ Gas and water are included . __eou__ Do I have to pay for electricity myself ? __eou__ Yes , electricity is not included in the rent .

You're not fat . __eou__ I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . __eou__ Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . __eou__ I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . __eou__ Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . __eou__ How much do they weigh ? __eou__ All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . __eou__ But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest .

Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? __eou__ Hi , I am just looking . __eou__ It's a good car . __eou__ What year is it ? __eou__ 1999 . __eou__ How about the mileage ? __eou__ 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . __eou__ What do you mean 7B __eou__ Highway miles are not as bad as local miles .

Does this car have a warranty ? __eou__ One month . __eou__ How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? __eou__ You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ $ 5,900 . __eou__ I'll have to think about it . __eou__ Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . __eou__ Okay .
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? __eou__ We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . __eou__ I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . __eou__ You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? __eou__ Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . __eou__ While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . __eou__ We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . __eou__ I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . __eou__ Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . __eou__ No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . __eou__ Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . __eou__ And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? __eou__ Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? __eou__ Four times might be enough . Not once or twice .
Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month . __eou__ Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? __eou__ Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ What did you do for your last move ? __eou__ Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out . __eou__ Oh . that's very nice of him . __eou__ Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . __eou__ Yes , please .
Miss , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . __eou__ It's because of the view . __eou__ Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? __eou__ Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . __eou__ How many elevators are there ? __eou__ There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . __eou__ How about the car-park space ? __eou__ There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . __eou__ Any other facilities ? __eou__ Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . __eou__ What is the completion date ? __eou__ The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . __eou__ How about the price and the bank mortgage ? __eou__ Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . __eou__ How many payment methods are there ? __eou__ It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . __eou__ Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . __eou__ You're welcome .
You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . __eou__ I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . __eou__ Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . __eou__ That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another .
Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? __eou__ I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . __eou__ How often dose this bus go there ? __eou__ Every fifteen minutes . __eou__ I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? __eou__ The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . __eou__ Where can I find the bus ? __eou__ The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome .
What is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . __eou__ I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now .
Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? __eou__ Yes , you're at the right stop . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Are you new here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . __eou__ Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? __eou__ One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . __eou__ I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? __eou__ It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus .
Here we are on the train . __eou__ Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . __eou__ I hear many people have cars . __eou__ Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . __eou__ Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? __eou__ Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . __eou__ I see .
Good coming , sir . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? __eou__ Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going to Wangfujing . __eou__ Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . __eou__ Thank you very much .
How much is the fare ? __eou__ Three yuan . __eou__ Could you tell me how to use it ? __eou__ You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . __eou__ Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? __eou__ That's very easy . The exit is always open . __eou__ Thank you for your help . __eou__ My pleasure .

Can I get that on the Accord ? __eou__ Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . __eou__ Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car . __eou__ You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__ Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . __eou__ Alright , sir .

I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' .

It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled .

I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big .

Can you make a suit for me to order ? __eou__ Certainly . Come and choose the cloth . __eou__ By the way , what's the charge for the tailoring ? __eou__ $ 150 including the cloth .
Waiter , show me the menu , please . __eou__ Yes , here you are .

How is your appetite today ? __eou__ I'm rather hungry now . __eou__ What would you like to have ? __eou__ Please give me a piece of pie first . __eou__ Which would you rather have , beef or chicken ? __eou__ Beef , please . __eou__ How about drinks ?

I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house . __eou__ My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ? __eou__ I know I should , but that place isn't very convenient . You have to wait for a long time . __eou__ Yes I know . I have to do it every week .

There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day . __eou__ Can I take the subway to get there ? __eou__ Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab . __eou__ Won't that be expensive ? __eou__ No , from here I think it's only about 5 dollars .
Did you order the cake ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot . __eou__ Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ Yeah . How about ' Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ' __eou__ I ’ m on it !

Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song . __eou__ What's so special about this song ? __eou__ It's from the musical that is so popular in New York right now . Do you like it ? __eou__ Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me . __eou__ That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation . __eou__ I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited . __eou__ Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ? __eou__ I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz .

I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? __eou__ Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? __eou__ Basically , there are 7 types of games __eou__ Well , I am a beginner . I ... __eou__ Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . __eou__ I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . __eou__ If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . __eou__ Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__ I will have the latest editions .

Let's go .
Have you bought War Craft 2 yet ? __eou__ Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ It's a great game .

I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over .

It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . __eou__ What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? __eou__ Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . __eou__ Faulty products ? __eou__ Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . __eou__ Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . __eou__ Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__ That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . __eou__ Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . __eou__ Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . __eou__ How many do you want to buy ? __eou__ I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? __eou__ You're right .
Have you any beef today ? __eou__ Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . __eou__ How much is it a pound ? __eou__ One pound and fifty pence a pound . __eou__ Good . I'll get three pounds of it . __eou__ Here it is . Four pounds and fifty pence in all .
Have you got some nice apples in stock today ? __eou__ What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . __eou__ Are they sweet ? __eou__ Very sweet . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each . __eou__ All right , I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones . __eou__ OK . Anything else ? __eou__ Do you have any tangerines ? I'd like to have two kilograms . __eou__ Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . __eou__ How much is it in all ? __eou__ Thirty dollars .
What is your policy on returns ? __eou__ If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__ That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? __eou__ Charge . Here's my card . __eou__ Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . __eou__ Thank you .
I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . __eou__ Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit . __eou__ Not really . It pinches my toes . __eou__ I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . __eou__ I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . __eou__ Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you .

Do you have a special location in mind ? __eou__ I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . __eou__ When would you like to move in ? __eou__ As soon as possible . __eou__ How about the end of this month ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? __eou__ I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . __eou__ Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . __eou__ Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . __eou__ That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it .
Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? __eou__ You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . __eou__ Do you charge for delivery ? __eou__ Wo will deliver the goods to you for free . __eou__ Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? __eou__ Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . __eou__ OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? __eou__ No later than tomorrow . __eou__ Thanks .
Good evening , sir . __eou__ Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . __eou__ Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? __eou__ On the rocks , please .
Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . __eou__ Boy , you are lost . It's across town . __eou__ Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? __eou__ You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there .
What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ How about drinking soda ? __eou__ Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . __eou__ That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ How do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now !
I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . __eou__ I said , " Do you want me to help you ? " __eou__ If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . __eou__ OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ?

I'm about to explode ! __eou__ Are you still mad at her now ? __eou__ To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done . __eou__ Will you apologize to her ? __eou__ No way . It ’ s her who should apologize .

Is this the right bus for San Francisco ? __eou__ It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine . __eou__ When's the first stop ? __eou__ About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Is it all right to smoke on the bus ? __eou__ Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed . __eou__ I see . Thank you .
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__ Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__ Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__ How much did she ask for ? __eou__ Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . '
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__ cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? __eou__ yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . __eou__ is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . __eou__ but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__ of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .
Is your father in the habit of having naps ? __eou__ Yes , all of us have naps . __eou__ Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? __eou__ No , not at all .
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure .
Are you ready , Pa ? __eou__ In a second . Have you got a torch ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Here it is . Let's go .
Let's see if we forget anything . __eou__ Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . __eou__ Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . __eou__ All right .
Do you like the cookies ? __eou__ I finished them in no time . __eou__ Glad you like it . __eou__ Mum , when will we have them again ?
What's your weight . __eou__ 150 pounds . __eou__ Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__ I can't bear eating less .
your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__ Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise . __eou__ By the way , do you work out ? __eou__ No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__ Fine .
Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? __eou__ No.Why ? __eou__ Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . __eou__ Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day .
I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . __eou__ Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . __eou__ You've formed a sound habit . __eou__ I think so , too .
Excuse me , ma'am ? __eou__ Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me .
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? __eou__ I attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__ Aren't you tired ? __eou__ No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? __eou__ It was okay . __eou__ Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No thanks , I'm not thirsty . __eou__ Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? __eou__ Yes I did . __eou__ Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? __eou__ Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual .
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday . __eou__ Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? __eou__ Yes , that would be good ! __eou__ We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? __eou__ If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . __eou__ You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? __eou__ Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . __eou__ Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . __eou__ Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . __eou__ Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift .
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . __eou__ A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .
Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' .
I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . __eou__ We have some fresh red roses . __eou__ How much are the roses ? __eou__ Twenty dollars per dozen . __eou__ That sounds like a good deal . __eou__ Yes , that is today's sale price . __eou__ I'll take a dozen . __eou__ Is there anything else you'd like to get ? __eou__ No , the roses will be fine . __eou__ I'm sure your wife will love them .
What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet !
Traffic rules are different among countries . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ People drive on the right in China . __eou__ Oh , that's interesting !
How can we avoid the jam ? __eou__ Let's take a roundabout way . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Look , traffic jam again !
Usually cities have greater traffic problems . __eou__ Of course , there're too many people . __eou__ I hate the car columns on the road . __eou__ But we couldn't help it .
I can't find proper parking space . __eou__ Let's just park here . __eou__ No , there's no parking sign . __eou__ Oh , the policeman's coming .
John , it ’ s time to get up . __eou__ It can ’ t be time to get up yet . __eou__ It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . __eou__ What ’ s the time ? __eou__ It ’ s nearly half past seven . __eou__ My watch says ten past . __eou__ It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__ Are you sure half past seven ? __eou__ Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . __eou__ ( And here is the seven o ’ clock news ) It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . __eou__ I could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
This is the rush hour . __eou__ I notice there's a jam a few blocks away . __eou__ Let's drive off this road . __eou__ I'm afraid I'll be late .
Why do you stop me ? __eou__ You have gone against the traffic rules . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ Do you know this is a Onaway street ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ You have to pay a fine .
Shit , so crowded ! __eou__ The radio said it's OK on this road . __eou__ Things change every minute . __eou__ We have too many cars !
How long do I have to wait ? __eou__ Two hours.That area is a little backward . __eou__ I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities . __eou__ You're right .
What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking __eou__ There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__ It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
Do you like shopping ? __eou__ Yeah . I go shopping once a week __eou__ Why don't you do your shopping at home ? __eou__ What do you mean ? I can't understand . __eou__ I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . __eou__ Really ? That's unbelievable .
Oh , here comes a bus ! __eou__ It's here at last ! __eou__ How long have you waited ? __eou__ Twenty minutes exactly .
I'll be late because I have waited so long ! __eou__ Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon . __eou__ I'd better take a taxi . __eou__ That's no use.This is morning rush hour .
Oh , the bus is gone . __eou__ Pity we didn't catch it . __eou__ I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . __eou__ We have to wait six more minutes !
Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? __eou__ Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted . __eou__ Have you ever seen such a nice house ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new . __eou__ It's great !
My dear , it's five flights up ! __eou__ That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . __eou__ We're little further away from the street and traffic noise __eou__ And there's no one living over us . __eou__ Is the place well-furnished ? __eou__ Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . __eou__ What about the kitchen ? __eou__ The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , __eou__ And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . __eou__ Are the plumbing all right ? __eou__ The plumbing seems OK , too . __eou__ The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water __eou__ And the sinks don't seem to leak . __eou__ The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again .
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . __eou__ You're so careless , Billy . __eou__ Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . __eou__ I've done it for you .
My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? __eou__ An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? __eou__ Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__ Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . __eou__ That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__ That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__ Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__ That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__ 256MB . __eou__ Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .
George , did you remember to buy me the book ? __eou__ Sorry , darling , I forgot . __eou__ When will you buy it then ? __eou__ I promise you'll have it tomorrow .
Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ? __eou__ Sure , Mum.In a minute . __eou__ Here's the money.And get some salt . __eou__ Yes , Mum .
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ No , I'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ Don't make a fuss.The price is rising
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? __eou__ I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . __eou__ What do you think is the biggest change ? __eou__ Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . __eou__ That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . __eou__ Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? __eou__ I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . __eou__ That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! __eou__ How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? __eou__ Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . __eou__ I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? __eou__ They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .
Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? __eou__ Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? __eou__ First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . __eou__ How can you get that done ? __eou__ Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . __eou__ What else ? __eou__ Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? __eou__ That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__ Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . __eou__ Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__ OK , I'll take it .
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__ Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited . __eou__ He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__ And the host announced that he won it all !
Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? __eou__ Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . __eou__ Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . __eou__ The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . __eou__ I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public .
Do you have any apartment to rent ? __eou__ Yes . Right now I have a studio . __eou__ Where is it . __eou__ In the downtown , near the square . __eou__ Is it furnished ? __eou__ Yes , and the rent includes utilities . __eou__ That's good . When can I go to see the house ? __eou__ What about next saturday . __eou__ Fine .
Excuse me , where am I on this map ? __eou__ You're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . __eou__ Which bus should I take to railway station ? __eou__ You can take a No . 2 bus here . __eou__ Where am I supposed to change ? __eou__ At Longing Street .
Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . __eou__ Great . Where is it ? __eou__ A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . __eou__ What about the surrounding area ? __eou__ Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants . __eou__ That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? __eou__ Yeah , it's near a bus stop . __eou__ Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then .
Have you ever thought about your ideal home ? __eou__ I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__ What would it be like ? __eou__ Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__ How many rooms would it have ? __eou__ I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . __eou__ How many bathrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ How would you decorate your house ? __eou__ I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . __eou__ How many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .
We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . __eou__ Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out . __eou__ Let's see . We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month . __eou__ That's $ 1 825 . __eou__ We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . __eou__ $ 3 075 . Our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 . __eou__ Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ? __eou__ Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . __eou__ All right .
Excuse me , can you tell me where central Park Street is ? __eou__ Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ No . It's only a ten-minute walk . __eou__ I see . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome .
Excuse me , where is the nearest bank ? __eou__ There is one next to the post office , round the corner . __eou__ Thank you .
Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? __eou__ Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ No , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . __eou__ Thank you .
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm not really that interested in those things . __eou__ They are very nice , you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh . I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody's buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion . There are so many other really important things in the world .
Excuse me , Is there a hotel nearby ? __eou__ The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . __eou__ how can I get there ? __eou__ just walk down this road and you'll find it . it's on the right side .
This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ? __eou__ Yes , of course.The dressing room is over there .
Can I help you ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm just looking .
Hello , may I speak to Kevin , please ? __eou__ Speaking .
Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate . __eou__ I ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? __eou__ It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome .
How much is this shirt , please ? __eou__ It's 89 yuan . __eou__ Do you have it in a larger size ? __eou__ Let me check .
Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ? __eou__ Yes , this is the right bus . __eou__ Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ? __eou__ Don't worry . I'll call out the stops . __eou__ ( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ? __eou__ No , don't worry . I'll get you off when you get there . __eou__ Is it a long ride ? __eou__ No , not that long . Two more stops , and you'll get off , sir . __eou__ OK . I know . Thank you . __eou__ Not at all .
Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ Of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ Has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know .
Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? __eou__ A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . __eou__ Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . __eou__ Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . __eou__ I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon . __eou__ Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure .
Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ Steven , are you talking to me ? __eou__ Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? __eou__ I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . __eou__ Did someone get hurt ? __eou__ A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . __eou__ What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? __eou__ I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . __eou__ Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? __eou__ I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool .
Hello ! Is your taxi engaged ? __eou__ No , this taxi is free . __eou__ Please take me to the Honging Hotel . __eou__ OK . Please get in . I'm glad to serve you . __eou__ Could you get there in twenty minutes ? __eou__ It will take half an hour to get to the hotel . __eou__ I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . I have a friend waiting for me . __eou__ OK , I promise we'll get there in twenty minutes . __eou__ Thanks .
It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ What kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ Ok , let's go then ! __eou__ Do you have any money ? __eou__ For what ? __eou__ For our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ You said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ I should have known ...
How is your house hunting going ? __eou__ Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ How much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! __eou__ How long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . __eou__ Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ No , I thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ I don't think I can afford that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that .
How do I get to the post office from school ? __eou__ Turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom . __eou__ OK , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__ You are welcome . Hope you can find it soon .
What's your apartment like ? __eou__ It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ What is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ Did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ How long is your contract for ? __eou__ That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ Have you started looking yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ Good luck !
Steven , what's the expense of moving house ? __eou__ About 3 000 dollars . __eou__ It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? __eou__ I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . __eou__ We have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__ Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income . __eou__ I hope so .
How far is it from here to the airport ? __eou__ It ’ s about an hour ’ s drive . __eou__ I need to get there before ten.Can we make it ? __eou__ I can ’ t promise , but I ’ ll do my best .
Julia , I have good news for you . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ I have earned a lot of money this week , more than I do in a fortnight . __eou__ It is really good news . How much do you earn a week now ? __eou__ My wages are six hundred dollars a week . But I find a part-time job to supplement my income . __eou__ Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important . __eou__ I know , darling . I must earn enough money to buy a car . I do a part-time job to increase my income . Don't worry , I will take care of myself . __eou__ I see . You must have more rest .
Hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ That depends . What is it ? __eou__ It's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ? __eou__ I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ If you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . __eou__ Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ That'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__ How about at 6 pm ? __eou__ See you then !

We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! __eou__ Let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? __eou__ What would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? __eou__ I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . __eou__ Well , let's get a plate of those then . __eou__ Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? __eou__ I think I might have a dahl . __eou__ What's in a dahl ? __eou__ It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . __eou__ That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__ Ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? __eou__ That's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__ I think I'll have a beer . __eou__ Ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . __eou__ You're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! __eou__ What would you do without me ?
This shirt is really nice . __eou__ You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ? __eou__ OK . I'll try on a medium size . __eou__ Here you are __eou__ Where is the fitting room ? __eou__ It's just around the comer . __eou__ It's too big tor me . Do you have a smaller one ? __eou__ Yes .

I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . __eou__ All right . I will get them for you .

Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . __eou__ Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? __eou__ Uh , no .

Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? __eou__ Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . __eou__ It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . __eou__ So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? __eou__ I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . __eou__ And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? __eou__ Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__ But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . __eou__ They're much better __eou__ But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . __eou__ That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . __eou__ Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . __eou__ I suppose so .

What do you think of this flat ? __eou__ It's not really all that good . The bedroom is a little small for us . __eou__ Small , but it should be enough for our needs .

We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . __eou__ Maybe we could get some new furniture . Better stuff . __eou__ I haven't thought of that .
You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . __eou__ It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable !
Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . __eou__ Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ?

He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . __eou__ To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too . __eou__ Yes , and he also ... __eou__ Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ? __eou__ Probably not . After all he is our teacher . We should try to find something nice to say . If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all . __eou__ I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now . __eou__ All right . I want to take a shower first , I ’ m exhausted .

I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . __eou__ Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . __eou__ Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either . __eou__ That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? __eou__ Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now . __eou__ There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend . __eou__ I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else . __eou__ How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . __eou__ Don't mention it .
Would you excuse me ? __eou__ For what ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got a business call that I really need to take . __eou__ All right . I ’ ll call you back later .
